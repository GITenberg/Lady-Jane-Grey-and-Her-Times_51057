<span class="subhead">The condition of Europe and England&mdash;Retrospect&mdash;Religious
Affairs&mdash;A reign of terror&mdash;Cranmer in danger&mdash;Katherine
Howard.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> 1546 it must have been evident to most
observers that the life of the man who had for
thirty-five years been England’s ruler and tyrant&mdash;of
whom Raleigh affirmed that if all the patterns
of a merciless Prince had been lost in the world they
might have been found in this one King&mdash;was not
likely to be prolonged; and though it had been
made penal to foretell the death of the sovereign,
men must have been secretly looking on to the
future with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>Of all the descendants of Henry VII. only one
was male, the little Prince Edward, and in case
of his death the succession would lie between his
two sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, branded by successive
Acts of Parliament with illegitimacy, the infant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Queen of Scotland, whose claims were consistently
ignored, and the daughters and grand-daughters of
Henry VII.’s younger daughter, Mary Tudor.</p>

<p>The royal blood was to prove, to more than one
of these, a fatal heritage. To Mary Stuart it was
to bring captivity and death, and by reason of it
Lady Jane Grey was to be forced to play the part
of heroine in one of the most tragic episodes of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The latter part of Henry VIII.’s reign had been
eventful at home and abroad. In Europe the three-cornered
struggle between the Emperor Charles V.,
Francis of France, and Henry had been passing
through various phases and vicissitudes, each of the
wrestlers bidding for the support of a second of the
trio, to the detriment of the third. New combinations
were constantly formed as the kaleidoscope was
turned; promises were lavishly made, to be broken
without a scruple whensoever their breach might
prove conducive to personal advantage. Religion,
dragged into the political arena, was used as a party
war-cry, and employed as a weapon for the destruction
of public and private foes.</p>

<p>At home, England lay at the mercy of a King who
was a law to himself and supreme arbiter of the destinies
of his subjects. Only obscurity, and not always
that, could ensure a man’s safety, or prevent him
from falling a prey to the jealousy or hate of those
amongst his enemies who had for the moment the ear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
of the sovereign. Pre-eminence in rank, or power,
or intellect, was enough to give the possessor of the
distinction an uneasy sense that he was marked out
for destruction, that envy and malice were lying
in wait to seize an opportunity to denounce him to
the weak despot upon whose vanity and cowardice
the adroit could play at will. Every year added
its tale to the long list of victims who had met their
end upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>For fifteen years, moreover, the country had been
delivered over to the struggle carried on in the
name of religion. In 1531 the King had responded
to the refusal of the Pope to sanction his divorce
from Katherine of Aragon by repudiating the
authority of the Holy See and the assertion of his
own supremacy in matters spiritual as well as
temporal. Three years later Parliament, servile and
subservient as Parliaments were wont to be under
the Tudor Kings, had formally endorsed and confirmed
the revolt.</p>

<p>“The third day of November,” recorded the
chronicler, “the King’s Highness held the high
Court of Parliament, in the which was concluded
and made many and sundry good, wholesome, and
godly statutes, but among all one special statute
which authorised the King’s Highness to be supreme
head of the Church of England, by which the
Pope ... was utterly abolished out of this realm.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Since then another punishable crime was added
to those, already none too few, for which a man
was liable to lose his head, and the following year
saw the death upon the scaffold of Fisher and
of More. The execution of Anne Boleyn, by
whom the match had, in some sort, been set to the
mine, came next, but the step taken by the King
was not to be retraced with the absence of the
motive which had prompted it; and Catholics and
Protestants alike had continued to suffer at the
hands of an autocrat who chastised at will those who
wandered from the path he pointed out, and refused
to model their creed upon the prescribed pattern.</p>

<p>In 1546 the “Act to abolish Diversity of
Opinion”&mdash;called more familiarly the Bloody Statute,
and designed to conform the faith of the nation
to that of the King&mdash;had been in force for seven
years, a standing menace to those persons, in high
or low place, who, encouraged by the King’s defiance
of Rome, had been emboldened to adopt the tenets
of the German Protestants. Henry had opened
the floodgates; he desired to keep out the flood.
The Six Articles of the Statute categorically reaffirmed
the principal doctrines of the Catholic
Church, and made their denial a legal offence. On
the other hand the refusal to admit the royal
supremacy in matters spiritual was no less penal.
A reign of terror was the result.</p>

<p>“Is thy servant a dog?” The time-honoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
question might have risen to the King’s lips in the
days, not devoid of a brighter promise, of his youth,
had the veil covering the future been withdrawn.
“We mark curiously,” says a recent writer, “the
regular deterioration of Henry’s character as the
only checks upon his action were removed, and
he progressively defied traditional authority and
established standards of conduct without disaster to
himself.” The Church had proved powerless to
punish a defiance dictated by passion and perpetuated
by vanity and cupidity; Parliaments had cringed to
him in matters religious or political, courtiers and
sycophants had flattered, until “there was no power
on earth to hold in check the devil in the breast
of Henry Tudor.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition of England. Old barriers
had been thrown down; new had not acquired
strength; in the struggle for freedom men had
cast aside moral restraint. Life was so lightly
esteemed, and death invested with so little tragic
importance, that a man of the position and standing
of Latimer, Bishop of Worcester, when appointed
to preach on the occasion of the burning of a
priest, could treat the matter with a flippant levity
scarcely credible at a later day.</p>

<p>“If it be your pleasure, as it is,” he wrote to
Cromwell, “that I shall play the fool after my
customary manner when Forest shall suffer, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
would that my stage stood near unto Forest” (so
that the victim might benefit by his arguments)....
“If he would yet with heart return to his abjuration,
I would wish his pardon, such is my foolishness.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Yet there was another side to the picture;
here and there, amidst the din of battle and the
confusion of tongues, the voice of genuine conviction
was heard; and men and women were ready,
at the bidding of conscience, to give up their lives
in passionate loyalty to an ancient faith or to a
new ideal. “And the thirtieth day of the same
month,” June 1540, runs an entry in a contemporary
chronicle, “was Dr. Barnes, Jerome, and Garrard,
drawn from the Tower to Smithfield, and there
burned for their heresies. And that same day also
was drawn from the Tower with them Doctor
Powell, with two other priests, and there was a
gallows set up at St. Bartholomew’s Gate, and
there were hanged, headed, and quartered that same
day”&mdash;the offence of these last being the denial
of the King’s supremacy, as that of the first had
been adherence to Protestant doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>No one was safe. The year 1540 had seen the
fall of Cromwell, the Minister of State. “Cranmer
and Cromwell,” wrote the French ambassador, “do
not know where they are.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Cromwell at least was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
not to wait long for the certainty. For years all-powerful
in the Council, he was now to fall a victim
to jealous hate and the credulity of the master he
had served. At his imprisonment “many lamented,
but more rejoiced, ... for they banquetted and
triumphed together that night, many wishing that
day had been seven years before; and some, fearing
that he should escape although he were imprisoned,
could not be merry.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> They need not have feared
the King’s clemency. The minister had been
arrested on June 10. On July 28 he was executed
on Tower Hill.</p>

<p>If Cromwell, in spite of his services to the Crown,
in spite of the need Henry had of men of his
ability, was not secure, who could call themselves
safe? Even Cranmer, the King’s special friend
though he was, must have felt misgivings. A
married man, with children, he was implicitly condemned
by one of the Six Articles of the Bloody
Statute, enjoining celibacy on the clergy, and was
besides well known to hold Protestant views. His
embittered enemy, Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester,
vehement in his Catholicism though pandering to
the King on the subject of the royal supremacy,
was minister; and his fickle master might throw
the Archbishop at any moment to the wolves.</p>

<p>One narrow escape he had already had, when
in 1544 a determined attempt had been hazarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to oust him from his position of trust and to convict
him of his errors, and the party adverse to him in
the Council had accused the Primate “most
grievously” to the King of heresy. It was a bold
stroke, for it was known that Henry loved him,
and the triumph of his foes was the greater when
they received the royal permission to commit the
Lord Archbishop to the Tower on the following
day, and to cause him to undergo an examination on
matters of doctrine and faith. So far all had gone
according to their hopes, and his enemies augured
well of the result. But that night, at eleven
o’clock, when Cranmer, in ignorance of the plot
against him, was in bed, he received a summons to
attend the King, whom he found in the gallery at
Whitehall, and who made him acquainted with the
action of the Council, together with his own consent
that an examination should take place.</p>

<p>“Whether I have done well or no, what say you,
my lord?” asked Henry in conclusion.</p>

<p>Cranmer answered warily. Knowing his master,
and his jealousy of being supposed to connive at
heresy, save on the one question of the Pope’s authority,
he cannot have failed to recognise the gravity of
the situation. He put, however, a good face upon
it. The King, he said, would see that he had a fair
trial&mdash;“was indifferently heard.” His bearing was
that of a man secure that justice would be done him.
Both he, in his heart, and the King, knew better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
“Oh, Lord God,” sighed Henry, “what fond
simplicity have you, so to permit yourself to be
imprisoned!” False witnesses would be produced,
and he would be condemned.</p>

<p>Taking his precautions, therefore, Henry gave
the Archbishop his ring&mdash;the recognised sign that
the matter at issue was taken out of the hands of
the Council and reserved for his personal investigation.
After which sovereign and prelate parted.</p>

<p>When, at eight o’clock the next morning, Cranmer,
in obedience to the summons he had received, arrived
at the Council Chamber, his foes, insolent in their
premature triumph, kept him at the door, awaiting
their convenience, close upon an hour. My lord
of Canterbury was become a lacquey, some one
reported to the King, since he was standing among
the footmen and servants. The King, comprehending
what was implied, was wroth.</p>

<p>“Have they served my lord so?” he asked.
“It is well enough; I shall talk with them by and
by.”</p>

<p>Accordingly when Cranmer, called at length and
arraigned before the Council, produced the ring&mdash;the
symbol of his enemies’ discomfiture&mdash;and
was brought to the royal presence that his cause
might be tried by the King in person, the positions
of accused and accusers were reversed. Acting, not
without passion, rather as the advocate of the menaced
man than as his judge, Henry received the Council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
with taunts, and in reply to their asseverations that
the trial had been merely intended to conduce to the
Archbishop’s greater glory, warned them against
treating his friends in that fashion for the future.
Cranmer, for the present, was safe.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Protestant England rejoiced with the Protestant
Archbishop. But it rejoiced in trembling. The
Archbishop’s escape did not imply immunity to lesser
offenders, and the severity used in administering the
law is shown by the fact that a boy of fifteen was
burnt for heresy&mdash;no willing martyr, but ignorant,
and eager to catch at any chances of life, by casting
the blame of his heresy on others. “The poor boy,”
says Hall, “would have gladly said that the twelve
Apostles taught it him ... such was his childish
innocency and fear.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> And England, with the
strange patience of the age, looked on.</p>

<p>Side by side with religious persecution ran
the story of the King’s domestic crimes. To go
back no further, in the year 1542 Katherine
Howard, Henry’s fifth wife, had met her fate,
and the country had silently witnessed the pitiful and
shameful spectacle. As fact after fact came to light,
the tale will have been told of the beautiful, neglected
child, left to her own devices and to the companionship
of maid-servants in the disorderly household
of her grandmother, the Duchess of Norfolk, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the results that might have been anticipated; of how
she had suddenly become of importance when it had
been perceived that the King had singled her out for
favour; and of how, still “a very little girl,” as
some one described her, she had been used as a pawn
in the political game played by the Howard clan,
and married to Henry. Only a few months after
she had been promoted to her perilous dignity her
doom had overtaken her; the enemies of the party
to which by birth she belonged had not only made
known to her husband misdeeds committed before
her marriage and almost ranking as the delinquencies
of a misguided child, but had hinted at
more unpardonable misdemeanours of which the
King’s wife had been guilty. The story of Katherine’s
arraignment and condemnation will have spread
through the land, with her protestations that, though
not excusing the sins and follies of her youth&mdash;she
was seventeen when she was done to death&mdash;she
was guiltless of the action she was specially to expiate
at the block; whilst men may have whispered the
tale of her love for Thomas Culpeper, her cousin
and playmate, whom she would have wedded had
not the King stepped in between, and who had
paid for her affection with his blood. “I die a
Queen,” she is reported to have exclaimed upon the
scaffold, “but I would rather have died the wife of
Culpeper.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> And it may have been rumoured that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
her head had fallen, not so much to vindicate the
honour of the King as to set him free to form
fresh ties.</p>

<p>However that might be, Katherine Howard had
been sent to answer for her offences, or prove her
innocence, at another bar, and her namesake, Katherine
Parr, reigned in her stead.</p>

<span class="subhead">Katherine Parr&mdash;Relations with Thomas Seymour&mdash;Married to
Henry VIII.&mdash;Parties in court and country&mdash;Katherine’s
position&mdash;Prince Edward.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was now three years since Katherine Parr had
replaced the unhappy child who had been her
immediate predecessor. For three perilous years
she had occupied&mdash;with how many fears, how many
misgivings, who can tell?&mdash;the position of the King’s
sixth wife. On a July day in 1543 Lady Latimer,
already at thirty twice a widow, had been raised
to the rank of Queen. If the ceremony was
attended with no special pomp, neither had it been
celebrated with the careful privacy observed with
respect to some of the King’s marriages. His two
daughters, Mary&mdash;approximately the same age as the
bride, and who was her friend&mdash;and Elizabeth, had
been present, as well as Henry’s brother-in-law,
Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, and other officers
of State. Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, afterwards
her dangerous foe, performed the rite, in the
Queen’s Closet at Hampton Court.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Seymour, Hertford’s brother and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Lord Admiral of England, was not at Hampton
Court on the occasion, having been despatched
on some foreign mission. More than one reason
may have contributed to render his absence advisable.
A wealthy and childless widow, of unblemished
reputation, and belonging by birth to a race connected
with the royal house, was not likely to remain
long without suitors, and Lord Latimer can scarcely
have been more than a month in his grave before
Thomas Seymour had testified his desire to replace
him and to become Katherine’s third husband. Nor
does she appear to have been backward in responding
to his advances.</p>

<p>Twice married to elderly men whose lives lay
behind them, twice set free by death from her
bonds, she may fairly have conceived that the time
was come when she was justified in wedding, not
for family or substantial reasons, not wholly perhaps,
as before, in wisdom’s way, but a man she loved.</p>

<p>Seymour was not without attractions calculated
to commend him to a woman hitherto bestowed
upon husbands selected for her by others. Young
and handsome, “fierce in courage, courtly in fashion,
in personage stately, in voice magnificent, but
somewhat empty in matter,”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> the gay sailor appears
to have had little difficulty in winning the heart of
a woman who, in spite of the learning, the prudence,
and the piety for which she was noted, may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
felt, as she watched her youth slip by, that she had
had little good of it; and it is clear, from a letter
she addressed to Seymour himself when, after
Henry’s death, his suit had been successfully renewed,
that she had looked forward at this earlier date to
becoming his wife.</p>

<p>“As truly as God is God,” she then wrote, “my
mind was fully bent, the other time I was at liberty,
to marry you before any man I know. Howbeit
God withstood my will therein most vehemently
for a time, and through His grace and goodness
made that possible which seemed to me most
impossible; that was, made me renounce utterly
mine own will and follow His most willingly. It
were long to write all the processes of this matter.
If I live, I shall declare it to you myself. I can
say nothing, but as my Lady of Suffolk saith, ‘God
is a marvellous man.’”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Strange burdens of responsibility have ever been
laid upon the duty of obedience to the will of
Providence, nor does it appear clear to the casual
reader why the consent of Katherine to become a
Queen should have been viewed by her in the
light of a sacrifice to principle. Whether her point
of view was shared by her lover does not appear.
It is at all events clear that both were wise enough
in the world’s lore not to brave the wrath of the
despot by crossing his caprice. Seymour retired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
from the field, and Katherine, perhaps sustained
by the inward approval of conscience, perhaps
partially comforted by a crown, accepted the
dangerous distinction she was offered.</p>

<p>To her brother, Lord Parr, when writing to
inform him of her advancement, she expressed no
regret. It had pleased God, she told him, to
incline the King to take her as his wife, the greatest
joy and comfort that could happen to her. She
desired to communicate the great news to Parr,
as being the person with most cause to rejoice
thereat, and added, with a suspicion of condescension,
her hope that he would let her hear of his health
as friendly as if she had not been called to this
honour.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Although the actual marriage had not taken place
until some six months after Lord Latimer’s death,
no time can have been lost in arranging it, since
before her husband had been two months in the
grave Henry was causing a bill for her dresses to
be paid out of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>It was generally considered that the King had
chosen well. Wriothesley, the Chancellor, was sure
His Majesty had never a wife more agreeable to his
heart. Gardiner had not only performed the marriage
ceremony but had given away the bride.
According to an old chronicle the new Queen was
a woman “compleat with singular humility.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
had, at any rate, the adroitness, in her relations with
the King, to assume the appearance of it, and was a
well-educated, sensible, and kindly woman, “quieter
than any of the young wives the King had had,
and, as she knew more of the world, she always got
on pleasantly with the King, and had no caprices.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The story of the marriage was an old one in 1546.
Seymour had returned from his mission and resumed
his former position at Court as the King’s brother-in-law
and the uncle of his heir, and not even the Queen’s
enemies&mdash;and she had enough of them and to spare&mdash;had
found an excuse for calling to mind the relations
once existing between the Admiral and the King’s
wife. Nevertheless, and in spite of the blamelessness
of her conduct, the satisfaction which had greeted the
marriage was on the wane. A hard task would have
awaited Queen or courtier who should have attempted
to minister to the contentment of all the rival
parties striving for predominance in the State and at
Court, and to be adjudged the friend of the one was
practically equivalent to a pledge of distrust from
the other. Whitehall, like the country at large, was
divided against itself by theological strife; and
whilst the men faithful to the ancient creed in its
entirety were inevitably in bitter opposition to the
adherents of the new teachers whose headquarters
were in Germany, a third party, more unscrupulous
than either, was made up of the middle men who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
moulded&mdash;outwardly or inwardly&mdash;their faith upon
the King’s, and would, if they could, have created a
Papacy without a Pope, a Catholic Church without
its corner-stone.</p>

<p>At Court, as elsewhere, each of these three
parties were standing on their guard, ready to
parry or to strike a blow when occasion arose,
jealous of every success scored by their opponents.
The fall of Cromwell had inspired the Catholics
with hope, and, with Gardiner as Minister and
Wriothesley as Chancellor, they had been in a more
favourable position than for some time past at the
date of the King’s last marriage. It had then been
assumed that the new Queen’s influence would be
employed upon their side&mdash;an expectation confirmed
by her friendship with the Princess Mary. The
discovery that the widow of Lord Latimer&mdash;so
fervent a Catholic that he had joined in the north-country
insurrection known as the Pilgrimage of
Grace&mdash;had broken with her past, openly displayed
her sympathy with Protestant doctrine, and, in
common with the King’s nieces, was addicted to
what was called the “new learning,” quickly disabused
them of their hopes, rendered the Catholic
party at Court her embittered enemies, and lent
additional danger to what was already a perilous
position by affording those at present in power a
motive for removing from the King’s side a woman
regarded as the advocate of innovation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
So far their efforts had been fruitless. Katherine
still held her own. During Henry’s absence in
France, whither he had gone to conduct the campaign
in person, she had administered the Government,
as Queen-Regent, with tact and discretion;
the King loved her&mdash;as he understood love&mdash;and,
what was perhaps a more important matter, she
had contrived to render herself necessary to him.
Wary, prudent, and pious, and notwithstanding the
possession of qualities marking her out in some sort
as the superior woman of her day, she was not above
pandering to his love of flattery. Into her book
entitled <cite>The Lamentations of a Sinner</cite>, she introduced
a fulsome panegyric of the godly and learned King
who had removed from his realm the veils and mists
of error, and in the guise of a modern Moses had
been victorious over the Roman Pharaoh. What she
publicly printed she doubtless reiterated in private;
and the King found the domestic incense soothing to
an irritable temper, still further acerbated by disease.</p>

<p>By other methods she had commended herself to
those who were about him open to conciliation. She
had served a long apprenticeship in the art of the step-mother,
both Lord Borough, her first husband, and
Lord Latimer having possessed children when she
married them; and her skill in dealing with the little
heir to the throne and his sisters proved that she
had turned her experience to good account. Her
genuine kindness, not only to Mary, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
her friend from the first, but to Elizabeth, ten years
old at the time of the marriage, was calculated to
propitiate the adherents of each; and to her good
offices it was in especial due that Anne Boleyn’s
daughter, hitherto kept chiefly at a distance from
Court, was brought to Whitehall. The child, young
as she was, was old enough to appreciate the importance
of possessing a friend in her father’s wife,
and the letter she addressed to her step-mother on
the occasion overflowed with expressions of devotion
and gratitude. To the place the Queen won in the
affections of the all-important heir, the boy’s letters
bear witness.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>HENRY VIII. AND HIS THREE CHILDREN.</p></div></div>

<p>There is no need to assume that Katherine’s
course of action was wholly dictated by interested
motives. Yet in this case principle and prudence
went hand in hand. Henry was becoming increasingly
sick and suffering, and, with the shadow
of death deepening above him, the gifts he asked
of life were insensibly changing their character.
His autocratic and violent temper remained the
same, but peace and quiet, a soothing atmosphere
of submissive affection, the absence of domestic
friction, if not sufficient to ensure his wife immunity
from peril, constituted her best chance of
escaping the doom of her predecessors. To a
selfish man the appeal must be to self-interest.
This appeal Katherine consistently made and it had
so far proved successful. For the rest, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
she suffered from terror of possible disaster
or resolutely shut her eyes to what might have
unnerved and rendered her unfit for the part she
had to play, none can tell, any more than it can
be determined whether, as she looked from the man
she had married to the man she had loved, she
indulged in vain regrets for the happiness of which
she had caught a glimpse in those brief days when
she had dreamed of a future to be shared with
Thomas Seymour.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of her caution, in spite of the
perfection with which she performed the duties of
wife and nurse, by 1546 disquieting reports were
afloat.</p>

<p>“I am confused and apprehensive,” wrote
Charles V.’s ambassador from London in the
February of that year, “to have to inform Your
Majesty that there are rumours here of a new
Queen, although I do not know how true they
be.... The King shows no alteration in his
behaviour towards the Queen, though I am informed
that she is annoyed by the rumours.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>With the history of the past to quicken her
apprehensions, she may well have been more than
“annoyed” by them. But, true or false, she
could but pursue the line of conduct she had
adopted, and must have turned with relief from
domestic anxieties to any other matters that could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
serve to distract her mind from her precarious
future. Amongst the learned ladies of a day when
scholarship was becoming a fashion she occupied
a foremost place, and was actively engaged in promoting
educational interests. Stimulated by her
step-mother’s approval, the Princess Mary had been
encouraged to undertake part of the translation of
Erasmus’s paraphrases of the Gospels; and Elizabeth
is found sending the Queen, as a fitting offering, a
translation from the Italian inscribed on vellum and
entitled the <cite>Glasse of the Synneful Soule</cite>, accompanying
it by the expression of a hope that, having
passed through hands so learned as the Queen’s,
it would come forth from them in a new form.
The education of the little Prince Edward too
was pushed rapidly forward, and at six years old,
the year of his father’s marriage, he had been
taken out of the hands of women and committed
to the tuition of John Cheke and Dr. Richard Cox.
These two, explains Heylyn, being equal in
authority, employed themselves to his advantage
in their several kinds&mdash;Dr. Cox for knowledge of
divinity, philosophy, and gravity of manners, Mr.
Cheke for eloquence in the Greek and Latin tongues;
whilst other masters instructed the poor child in modern
languages, so that in a short time he spoke French
perfectly, and was able to express himself “magnificently
enough” in Italian, Greek, and Spanish.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
His companion and playfellow was one Barnaby
Fitzpatrick, to whom he clung throughout his short
life with constant affection. It was Barnaby’s office
to bear whatever punishment the Prince had merited&mdash;a
method more successful in the case of the Prince
than it might have proved with a less soft-hearted
offender, since it is said that “it was not easy to
affirm whether Fitzpatrick smarted more for the
default of the Prince, or the Prince conceived more
grief for the smart of Fitzpatrick.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Katherine Parr is not likely to have regretted
the pressure put upon her stepson; and the boy,
apologising for his simple and rude letters, adds his
acknowledgments for those addressed to him by
the Queen, “which do give me much comfort and
encouragement to go forward in such things wherein
your Grace beareth me on hand.”</p>

<p>The King’s latest wife was, in fact, a teacher by
nature and choice, and admirably fitted to direct the
studies of his son and daughters, as well as of any
other children who might be brought within the
sphere of her influence. That influence, it may be,
had something to do with moulding the character
and the destiny of a child fated to be unhappily
prominent in the near future. This was Lady Jane
Grey.</p>

<span class="subhead">1546</span>

<span class="subhead">The Marquis of Dorset and his family&mdash;Bradgate Park&mdash;Lady Jane
Grey&mdash;Her relations with her cousins&mdash;Mary Tudor&mdash;Protestantism
at Whitehall&mdash;Religious persecution.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Amongst</span> the households where both affairs at
Court and the religious struggle distracting
the country were watched with the deepest interest
was that of the Marquis of Dorset, the husband
of the King’s niece and father of Lady Jane Grey.</p>

<p>Married at eighteen to the infirm and aged Louis
XII. of France, Mary Tudor, daughter of Henry VII.
and friend of the luckless Katherine of Aragon, had
been released by his death after less than three
months of wedded life, and had lost no time in
choosing a more congenial bridegroom. At Calais,
on her way home, she had bestowed her hand upon
“that martial and pompous gentleman,” Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, who, sent by her brother
to conduct her back to England, thought it well to
secure his bride and to wait until the union was
accomplished before obtaining the King’s consent.
Of this hurried marriage the eldest child was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
mother of Jane Grey, who thus derived her disastrous
heritage of royal blood.</p>

<p>It was at the country home of the Dorset family,
Bradgate Park, that Lady Jane had been born, in
1537. Six miles distant from the town of Leicester,
and forming the south-east end of Charnwood
Forest, it was a pleasant and quiet place. Over the
wide park itself, seven miles in circumference,
bracken grew freely; here and there bare rocks rose
amidst the masses of green undergrowth, broken
now and then by a solitary oak, and the unwooded
expanse was covered with “wild verdure.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The house itself had not long been built, nor is
there much remaining at the present day to show
what had been its aspect at the time when Lady Jane
was its inmate. Early in the eighteenth century it
was destroyed by fire, tradition ascribing the catastrophe
to a Lady Suffolk who, brought to her
husband’s home as a bride, complained that the
country was a forest and the inhabitants were
brutes, and, at the suggestion of her sister, took
the most certain means of ensuring a change of
residence.</p>

<p>But if little outward trace is left of the place
where the victim of state-craft and ambition was born
and passed her early years, it is not a difficult matter
to hazard a guess at the religious and political atmosphere
of her home. Echoes of the fight carried on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
openly or covertly, between the parties striving for
predominance in the realm must have almost daily
reached Bradgate, the accounts of the incidents
marking the combat taking their colour from the
sympathies of the master and mistress of the house,
strongly enlisted upon the side of Protestantism. At
Lord Dorset’s house, though with closed doors,
the condition of religious affairs must have supplied
constant matter for discussion; and Jane will have
listened to the conversation with the eager attention
of an intelligent child, piecing together the fragments
she gathered up, and gradually realising, with a thrill
of excitement, as she became old enough to grasp the
significance of what she heard, that men and women
were suffering and dying in torment for the sake
of doctrines she had herself been taught as a matter
of course. Serious and precocious, and already beginning
an education said to have included in later
years Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabic, French,
and Italian, the stories reaching her father’s house of
the events taking place in London and at Court must
have imprinted themselves upon her imagination at
an age specially open to such impressions, and it is
not unnatural that she should have grown up nurtured
in the principles of polemics and apt at controversy.</p>

<p>Nor were edifying tales of martyrdom or of
suffering for conscience’ sake the only ones to penetrate
to the green and quiet precincts of Bradgate.
At his niece’s house the King’s domestic affairs&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>a
scandal and a by-word in Europe&mdash;must have
been regarded with the added interest, perhaps the
sharper criticism, due to kinship. Henry was not
only Lady Dorset’s sovereign, but her uncle, and she
had a more personal interest than others in what
Messer Barbaro, in his report to the Venetian
senate, described as “this confusion of wives.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> To
keep a child ignorant was no part of the training
of the day, and Jane, herself destined for a court
life, no doubt had heard, as she grew older,
many of the stories of terror and pity circulating
throughout the country, and investing, in the eyes of
those afar off, the distant city&mdash;the stage whereon
most of them had been enacted&mdash;with the atmosphere
of mystery and fear and excitement belonging to a
place where martyrs were shedding their blood, or
heretics atoning for their guilt, according as the
narrators inclined to the ancient or the novel faith;
where tragedies of love and hatred and revenge
were being played, and men went in hourly peril
of their lives.</p>

<p>Of this place, invested with the attraction and
glamour belonging to a land of glitter and romance,
Lady Jane had glimpses on the occasions when,
as a near relation of the King’s, she accompanied
her mother to Court, becoming for a while a
sharer in the life of palaces and an actor, by
reason of her strain of royal blood, in the pageant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
ever going forward at St. James’s or Whitehall;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
and though it does not appear that she was finally
transferred from the guardianship of her parents to
that of the Queen until after the death of Henry
in the beginning of the year 1547, it is not unlikely
that the book-loving child of nine may have attracted
the attention of the scholarly Queen during her
visits to Court and that Katherine’s belligerent
Protestantism had its share in the development of
the convictions which afterwards proved so strong
both in life and in death.</p>

<p>There is at this date little trace of any connection
between Jane and her cousins, the King’s
children. A strong affection on the part of Edward
is said to have existed, and to it has been attributed
his consent to set his sisters aside in Lady Jane’s
favour. “She charmed all who knew her,” says
Burnet, “in particular the young King, about
whom she was bred, and who had always lived
with her in the familiarity of a brother.” For
this statement there is no contemporary authority,
and, so far as can be ascertained, intercourse between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the two can have been but slight. Between
Edward and his younger sister, on the other hand,
the bond of affection was strong, their education
being carried on at this time much together
at Hatfield; and “a concurrence and sympathy
of their natures and affections, together with the
celestial bond, conformity in religion,”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> made it
the more remarkable that the Prince should have
afterwards agreed to set aside, in favour of his
cousin, Elizabeth’s claim to the succession. It is
true that in their occasional meetings the studious
boy and the serious-minded little girl may have
discovered that they had tastes in common, but such
casual acquaintanceship can scarcely have availed to
counterbalance the affection produced by close companionship
and the tie of blood; and grounds
for the Prince’s subsequent conduct, other than the
influence and arguments of those about him, can
only be matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>Of the relations existing between Jane and the
Prince’s sisters there is little more mention; but
the entry by Mary Tudor in a note-book of the
gift of a gold necklace set with pearls, made “to
my cousin, Jane Gray,” shows that the two had
met in the course of this summer, and would seem
to indicate a kindly feeling on the part of the older
woman towards the unfortunate child whom, not
eight years later, she was to send to the scaffold.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Could the future have been laid bare it would
perhaps not have been the victim who would have
recoiled from the revelation with the greatest
horror.</p>

<p>Although what was to follow lends a tragic significance
to the juxtaposition of the names of the two
cousins, there was nothing sinister about the King’s
elder daughter as she filled the place at Court in
which she had been reinstated at the instance of her
step-mother. A gentle, brown-eyed woman, past
her first youth, and bearing on her countenance
the traces of sickness and sorrow and suffering,
she enjoyed at this date so great a popularity as
almost, according to a foreign observer, to be an
object of adoration to her father’s subjects, obstinately
faithful to her injured and repudiated
mother. But, ameliorated as was the Princess’s
condition, she had been too well acquainted, from
childhood upwards, with the reverses of fortune to
count over-securely upon a future depending upon
her father’s caprice.</p>

<p>Her health was always delicate, and during the early
part of the year she had been ill. By the spring,
however, she had resumed her attendance at Court,
and&mdash;to judge by a letter from her little wise brother,
contemplating from a safe distance the dangerous
pastimes of Whitehall&mdash;was taking a conspicuous
part in the entertainments in fashion. Writing in
Latin to his step-mother, Prince Edward besought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
her “to preserve his dear sister Mary from the
enchantments of the Evil One, by beseeching her
no longer to attend to foreign dances and merriments,
unbecoming in a most Christian Princess”&mdash;and
least of all in one for whom he expressed the
wish, in the course of the same summer, that the
wisdom of Esther might be hers.</p>

<p>It does not appear whether or not Mary took
the admonitions of her nine-year-old Mentor to
heart. The pleasures of court life are not likely
to have exercised a perilous fascination over the
Princess, her spirits clouded by the memory of her
melancholy past and the uncertainty of her future,
and probably represented to her a more or less
wearisome part of the necessary routine of existence.</p>

<p>Whilst the entertainments the Prince deplored
went forward at Whitehall, they were accompanied
by other practices he would have wholly approved.
Not only was his step-mother addicted to personal
study of the Scriptures, but she had secured the
services of learned men to instruct her further in
them; holding private conferences with these
teachers; and, especially during Lent, causing a
sermon to be delivered each afternoon for her own
benefit and that of any of her ladies disposed to
profit by it, when the discourse frequently turned or
touched upon abuses in the Church.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>It was a bold stroke, Henry’s claims to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
position of sole arbiter on questions of doctrine
considered. Nevertheless the Queen acted openly,
and so far her husband had testified no dissatisfaction.
Yet the practice must have served to accentuate
the dividing line of theological opinion, already
sufficiently marked at Court; some members of
the royal household, like Princess Mary, holding
aloof; others eagerly welcoming the step; the
Seymours, Cranmer, and their friends looking on
with approval, whilst the Howard connection, with
Gardiner and Wriothesley, took note of the Queen’s
imprudence, and waited and watched their opportunity
to turn it to their advantage and to her
destruction.</p>

<p>Such was the internal condition of the Court.
The spring had meanwhile been marked by rejoicings
for the peace with foreign powers, at last concluded.
On Whit-Sunday a great procession proceeded from
St. Paul’s to St. Peter’s, Cornhill, accompanied by a
banner, and by crosses from every parish church,
the children of St. Paul’s School joining in the show.
It was composed of a motley company. Bishop
Bonner&mdash;as vehement in his Catholicism as Gardiner,
and so much less wary in the display of his opinions
that his brother of Winchester was wont at times to
term him “asse”&mdash;carried the Blessed Sacrament
under a canopy, with “clerks and priests and vicars
and parsons”; the Lord Mayor was there in crimson
velvet, the aldermen were in scarlet, and all the crafts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in their best apparel. The occasion was worthy of
the pomp displayed in honour of it, for it was&mdash;the
words sound like a jest&mdash;the festival of a “Universal
Peace for ever,” announced by the Mayor, standing
between standard and cross, and including in the
proclamation of general amity the names of the
Emperor, the King of England, the French King,
and all Christian Kings.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>If soldiers had for the moment consented to
proclaim a truce and to name it, merrily, eternal,
theologians had agreed to no like suspension of
hostilities, and the perennial religious strife showed
no signs of intermission.</p>

<p>“Sire,” wrote Admiral d’Annebaut, sent by
Francis to London to ratify the peace, “I know
not what to tell your Majesty as to the order given
me to inform myself of the condition of religious
affairs in England; except that Henry has declared
himself head of the Anglican Church, and woe
to whomsoever refuses to recognise him in that
capacity. He has also usurped all ecclesiastical
property, and destroyed all the convents. He
attends Mass nevertheless daily, and permits the
papal nuncio to live in London. What is strangest
of all is that Catholics are there burnt as well as
Lutherans and other heretics. Was anything like
it ever seen?”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Punishment was indeed dealt out with singular
impartiality. During the spring Dr. Crome had
been examined touching a sermon he had delivered
against Catholic doctrine. Two or three weeks
later, preaching once more at Paul’s Cross, he had
boldly declared he was not there for the purpose
of denying his former assertions; but a second
“examination” had proved more effective, and on
the Sunday following the feast of Corpus Christi he
eschewed his heresies.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> “Our news here,” wrote a
merchant of London to his brother on July 2, “of
Dr. Crome’s canting, recanting, decanting, or rather
double-canting, be this.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The transaction was
representative of many others, which, with their
undercurrent of terror, struggle, intimidation,
menace, and remorse, formed a melancholy and
recurrent feature of the day, the victory remaining
sometimes with a man’s conscience&mdash;whatever it
dictates might be&mdash;sometimes with his fears.</p>

<p>The King was, in fact, still endeavouring to stem
the torrent he had set loose. In his speech to
Parliament on Christmas Eve, 1545, after commending
and thanking Lords and Commons for
their loyalty and affection towards himself, he had
spoken with severity of the discord and dissension
prevalent in the realm; the clergy, by their sermons
against each other, sowing debate and discord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
amongst the people.... “I am very sorry to know
and hear how unreverently that most precious jewel,
the Word of God, is disputed, rimed, sung and
jangled in every ale-house and tavern ... and
yet I am even as much sorry that the readers of the
same follow it in doing so faintly and so coldly.
For of this I am sure, that charity was never so
faint amongst you, and virtuous and godly living
was never less used, nor God Himself amongst
Christians was never less reverenced, honoured, and
served.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Delivered scarcely more than a year before his
death, Henry’s speech was a singular commentary
upon the condition of the realm, consequent upon
his own policy, during the concluding years of his
reign.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> the months of 1546 went by the measures
taken by the King and his advisers to enforce
unanimity of practice and opinion in matters of
religion did not become less drastic. A great
burning of books disapproved by Henry took place
during the autumn, preceded in July by the
condemnation and execution of a victim whose
fate attracted an unusual amount of attention, the
effect at Court being enhanced by the fact that the
heroine of the story was personally known to the
Queen and her ladies. It was indeed reported that
one of the King’s special causes of displeasure was
that she had been the means of imbuing his nieces&mdash;among

well as his wife, with heretical doctrines.</p>

frame, her undaunted courage, and her final agony
at the stake, may well have haunted with the
horror of a night-mare those who had been her
disciples, and who looked on from a distance, and
with sympathy they dared not display.</p>

<p>There were other circumstances increasing the
interest with which the melancholy drama was
watched. Well born and educated, Anne had been
the wife of a Lincolnshire gentleman of the name
of Kyme. Their life together had been of short
duration. In a period of bitter party feeling and
recrimination, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty
the truth on any given point; and whilst a hostile
chronicler asserts that Anne left her husband in
order “to gad up and down a-gospelling and
gossipping where she might and ought not, but
especially in London and near the Court,”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> another
authority explains that Kyme had turned her out
of his house upon her conversion to Protestant
doctrines. Whatever might have been the origin
of her mode of life, it is certain that she resumed
her maiden name, and proceeded to “execute the
office of an apostle.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Her success in her new profession made her
unfortunately conspicuous, and in 1545 she was
committed to Newgate, “for that she was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
obstinate and heady in reasoning on matters of
religion.” The charge, it must be confessed, is
corroborated by her demeanour under examination,
when the qualities of meekness and humility were
markedly absent, and her replies to the interrogatories
addressed to her were rather calculated to
irritate than to prove conciliatory. On this first
occasion, for example, asked to interpret certain
passages in the Scriptures, she declined to comply
with the request on the score that she would not
cast pearls among swine&mdash;acorns were good enough;
and, urged by Bonner to open her wound, she
again refused. Her conscience was clear, she said;
to lay a plaster on a whole skin might seem much
folly, and the similitude of a wound appeared to her
unsavoury.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>For the time she escaped; but in the course of
the following year her case was again brought
forward, and on this occasion she found no mercy.
Her examinations, mostly reported by herself, show
her as alike keen-witted and sharp-tongued, rarely
at a loss for an answer, and profoundly convinced
of the justice of her cause. If she was not without
the genuine enjoyment of the born controversialist
in the opportunity of argument and discussion, she
possessed, underlying the self-assertion and confidence
natural in a woman holding the position of a
religious leader, a fund of indomitable heroism.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
For she must have been fully conscious of her
danger. It is possible that, had she not been
brought into prominence by her association with
those in high places, she might again have escaped;
but, apart from the grudge owed her for her
influence over the King’s own kin, her attitude
was almost such as to court her fate. Refusing “to
sing a new song of the Lord in a strange land,”
she replied to the Bishop of Winchester, when he
complained that she spoke in parables, that it was
best for him that she should do so. Had she
shown him the open truth, he would not accept it.</p>

<p>“Then the Bishop said he would speak with me
familiarly. I said, ‘So did Judas when he unfriendlily
betrayed Christ....’ In conclusion,” she ended, in
her account of the interview, “we could not agree.”</p>

<p>Spirited as was her bearing, and thrilling as the
prisoner plainly was with all the excitement of a battle
of words, it was not strange that the strain should
tell upon her.</p>

<p>“On the Sunday,” she proceeds&mdash;and there is a
pathetic contrast between the physical weakness to
which she confesses and her undaunted boldness in
confronting the men bent upon her destruction&mdash;“I
was sore sick, thinking no less than to die....
Then was I sent to Newgate in my extremity of
sickness, for in all my life I was never in such pain.
Thus the Lord strengthen us in His truth. Pray,
pray, pray.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Her condemnation was a foregone conclusion. It
followed quickly, with a subsequent visit from one
Nicholas Shaxton, who, having, for his own part,
made his recantation, counselled her to do the same.
He spoke in vain. It were, she told him, good for
him never to have been born, “with many like
words.” More was to follow. If her assertion is to
be believed&mdash;and there seems no valid reason to doubt
it&mdash;the rack was applied “till I was nigh dead....
After that I sat two long hours reasoning with my
Lord Chancellor upon the bare floor. Then was I
brought into a house and laid in a bed with as weary
and painful bones as ever had patient Job. I thank
my God therefore.”</p>

<p>A scarcely credible addition is made to the story,
to the effect that when the Lieutenant of the Tower
had refused to put the victim to the torture a second
time, the Lord Chancellor, Wriothesley, less merciful,
took the office upon himself, and applied the rack
with his own hands, the Lieutenant departing to
report the matter to the King, “who seemed not very
well to like such handling of a woman.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> What is
certain is the final scene at Smithfield, where Shaxton
delivered a sermon, Anne listening, endorsing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
words when she approved of them and correcting
them “when he said amiss.”</p>

<p>So the shameful episode was brought to an end.
The tale, penetrating even the thick walls of a
palace, must have caused a thrill of horror at
Whitehall, accentuated by reason of certain events
going forward there about the same time.</p>

<p>The King’s disease was gaining upon him apace.
He had become so unwieldy in bulk that the use
of machinery was necessary to move him, and with
the progress of his disorder his temper was becoming
more and more irritable. In view of his approaching
death the question of the guardianship and custody
of the heir to the throne was increasing in importance
and the jealousy of the rival parties was becoming
more embittered. In the course of the summer the
Catholics about the Court ventured on a bold stroke,
directed against no less a person than the Queen.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the tolerance displayed by the
King towards her religious practices and the preachers
and teachers she gathered around her, Katherine had
grown so daring as to make matters of doctrine a
constant subject of conversation with Henry, urging
him to complete the work he had begun, and to free
the Church of England from superstition.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Henry
appears at first&mdash;though he was a man ill to argue
with&mdash;to have shown singular patience under his
wife’s admonitions. But daily controversy is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
soothing to a sick man’s nerves and temper, and
Katherine’s enemies, watching their opportunity,
conceived that it was at hand.</p>

<p>Henry’s habits had been altered by illness, and it
had become the Queen’s custom to wait for a
summons before visiting his apartments; although
on some occasions, after dinner or supper, or when
she had reason to imagine she would be welcome,
she repaired thither on her own initiative. But
perhaps the more as she perceived that time was
short, she continued her imprudent exhortations.
And still her enemies, wary and silent, watched.</p>

<p>Henry appears&mdash;and it says much for his affection
for her&mdash;to have for a time maintained the attitude
of a not uncomplacent listener. On a certain day,
however, when Katherine was, as usual, descanting
upon questions of theology, he changed the subject
abruptly, “which somewhat amazed the Queen.”
Reassured by perceiving no further signs of displeasure,
she talked upon other topics until the
time came for the King to bid her farewell, which
he did with his customary affection.</p>

<p>The account of what followed&mdash;Foxe being, as
before, the narrator&mdash;must be accepted with reservation.
Gardiner, chancing to be present, was made
the recipient of his master’s irritation. It was a good
hearing, the King said ironically, when women were
become clerks, and a thing much to his comfort, to
come in his old days to be taught by his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Gardiner made prompt use of the opening afforded
him; he had waited long for it, and it was not
wasted. The Queen, he said, had forgotten herself,
in arguing with a King whose virtues and whose
learnedness in matters of religion were not only
greater than were possessed by other princes, but
exceeded those of doctors in divinity. For the
Bishop and his friends it was a grievous thing to
hear. Proceeding to enlarge upon the subject at
length, he concluded by saying that, though he
dared not declare what he knew without special
warranty from the King, he and others were aware
of treason cloaked in heresy. Henry, he warned
him, was cherishing a serpent in his bosom.</p>

<p>It was risking much, but the Bishop knew to
whom he spoke, and, working adroitly upon
Henry’s fears and wrath, succeeded in obtaining
permission to consult with his colleagues and to draw
up articles by which the Queen’s life might be
touched. “They thought it best to begin with such
ladies as she most esteemed and were privy to all her
doings&mdash;as the Lady Herbert, her sister, the Lady
Lane, who was her first cousin, and the Lady
Tyrwhitt, all of her privy chamber.” The plan
was to accuse these ladies of the breach of the Six
Articles, to search their coffers for documents or
books compromising to the Queen, and, in case anything
of that nature were found, to carry Katherine
by night to the Tower. The King, acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the design, appears to have given his consent, and
all went on as before, Henry still encouraging,
or at least not discouraging, his wife’s discourse on
spiritual matters.</p>

<p>Time was passing; the bill of articles against the
Queen had been prepared, and Henry had affixed his
signature to it, whether with a deliberate intention
of giving her over to her enemies, or, as some said,
meaning to deter her from the study of prohibited
literature&mdash;in which case, as Lord Herbert of
Cherbury observes, it was “a terrible jest.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> That
Katherine herself did not regard the affair, as soon
as she came to be cognisant of it, in the light of a
kindly warning, is plain; for when, by a singular
accident, the document containing the charges against
her was dropped by one of the council and brought
for her perusal, the effect upon her was such that the
King’s physicians were summoned to attend her, and
Henry himself, ignorant of the cause of her illness,
and possibly softened by it, paid her a visit, and,
hearing that she entertained fears that she had
incurred his displeasure, reassured her with sweet
and comfortable words, remained with her an hour,
and departed.</p>

<p>Though Katherine had played her part well, she
must have been aware that she stood on the brink of
a precipice, and the ghosts of Anne Boleyn and
Katherine Howard warned her how little reliance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
could be placed upon the King’s fitful affection.
Deciding upon a bold step, she sought his bed-chamber
uninvited after supper on the following
evening, attended only by her sister, Lady Herbert,
and with Lady Lane,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> her cousin, to carry the candle
before her. Henry, found in conversation with
his attendant gentlemen, gave his wife a courteous
welcome, entering at once&mdash;contrary to his custom&mdash;upon
the subject of religion, as if moved by a desire
of gaining instruction from her replies. Read in the
light of what Katherine already knew, this new
departure may well have been viewed by her with
misgiving; and she hastened to disclaim the position
the King appeared anxious to assign her. The
inferiority of women being what it was, she said, it
was for man to supply from his wisdom what they
lacked. She being a silly poor woman, and his
Majesty so wise, how could her judgment be of
use to him, in all things her only anchor, and, next
to God, her supreme head and governor on earth?</p>

<p>The King demurred. The attitude of submission
may have struck him as unfamiliar.</p>

<p>“Not so, by St. Mary,” he said. “You are
become a doctor, Kate, to instruct us, as we take
it, and not to be instructed or directed by us.”</p>

<p>The plain charge elicited, it was more easy
to reply to it. The King had much mistaken her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Katherine humbly declared. It had ever been her
opinion that it was unseemly for the woman to
instruct and teach her lord and husband; her place
was rather to learn of him. If she had been bold
to maintain opinions differing from the King’s, it
had been to “minister talk”&mdash;to make conversation,
in modern language&mdash;to distract him from the
thought of his infirmities, as also in the hope of profiting
by his learned discourse&mdash;with more of the
same nature.</p>

<p>Henry, perhaps not sorry to be convinced, yielded
to the skilful flattery thus administered.</p>

<p>“Is it even so, sweetheart?” he said, “and tend
your arguments to no worse end? Then perfect
friends we are now again,” adding, as he took her
in his arms and kissed her, that her words had done
him more good than news of a hundred thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>The next day had been fixed for the Queen’s
arrest. As the appointed hour approached the
King sought the garden, sending for Katherine to
attend him there. Accompanied by the same ladies
as on the night before, the Queen obeyed the
summons, and there, under the July sun, the closing
scene of the serio-comic drama was played. Amused,
it may be, by the anticipation of his counsellors’
discomfiture, Henry was in good spirits and “as
pleasant as ever he was in his life before,” when
the Chancellor, with forty of the royal guard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
appeared, ready to take possession of the culprit.
What passed between Wriothesley and his master,
at a little distance from the rest of the party, could
only be matter of conjecture. The Chancellor’s
words, as he knelt before the angry King, were not
audible to the curious bystanders, but the King’s
rejoinder, “vehemently whispered,” was heard.
“Knave, arrant knave, beast and fool,” were the
epithets applied to the crestfallen official. After
which, he was promptly dismissed.</p>

<p>Katherine, whether or not she divined the truth,
set herself to plead Wriothesley’s cause. Ignorance,
not will, was in her opinion the probable origin of
what had so manifestly moved Henry to wrath.
The advocacy of the intended victim softened the
King’s heart even more towards her.</p>

<p>“Ah, poor soul,” he said, “thou little knowest
how ill he deserves this grace at thy hands. On
my word, sweetheart, he hath been towards thee an
arrant knave, and so let him go.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>For the moment, at least, the danger was averted,
and before it recurred the despot was in his grave,
and Katherine was safe. It is curious to observe
that in the list of contents to the <cite>Acts and Monuments</cite>
the danger of the Queen is pointed out, “and how
gloriously she was preserved by her kind and loving
Husband the King.”</p>

<span class="subhead">1546</span>

<span class="subhead">The King dying&mdash;The Earl of Surrey&mdash;His career and his fate&mdash;The
Duke of Norfolk’s escape&mdash;Death of the King.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> King was dying. So much must have
been apparent to all who were in a position to
judge. None, however, dared utter their thought,
since it had been made an indictable offence&mdash;the
act being directed against soothsayers and prophets&mdash;to
foretell his death. Those who wished him well
or ill, those who would if they could have cared
for his soul and invited him to make his peace with
God before taking his way hence, were alike constrained
to be mute. Before he went to present
himself at a court of justice where king and crossing-sweeper
stand side by side, another judicial murder
was to be accomplished, and one more victim added
to the number of the accusers awaiting him there.
This was the poet Earl of Surrey, heir to the
Dukedom of Norfolk.</p>

<p>Surrey was not more than thirty. But much had
been crowded, according to the fashion of the time,
into his short and brilliant life. Brought up during
his childhood at Windsor as the companion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
King’s illegitimate son, the Duke of Richmond&mdash;who
subsequently married Mary Howard, his
friend’s sister&mdash;Surrey had suffered many vicissitudes
of fortune; had been in confinement on
a suspicion of sympathy with the Pilgrimage of
Grace; and in 1543 had again fallen into disgrace,
charged with breaking windows in London by
shooting pebbles at them. To this accusation he
pleaded guilty, explaining, in a satire directed against
the citizens of London, that his object had been
to prepare them for the divine retribution due for
their irreligion and wickedness:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This made me with a reckless brest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To wake thy sluggards with my bowe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A figure of the Lord’s behest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose scourge for synne the Scriptures shew.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He can scarcely have expected that the plea
would have availed, and he expiated his offence by
a short imprisonment, chiefly of importance as accentuating
his hatred towards the Seymours, who were
held responsible for it.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>In the course of the same year he was more
worthily employed in fighting the battles of England
abroad, where his conduct elicited a cordial tribute
of praise from Charles V. “Our cousin, the Earl
of Surrey,” wrote the Emperor to Henry, on
Surrey’s return to England, would supply him with
an account of all that had taken place. “We will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
therefore only add that he has given good proof
in the army of whom he is the son; and that he
will not fail to follow in the steps of his father and
forefathers, with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">si gentil cœur</i> and so much dexterity
that there is no need to instruct him in aught, and
you will give him no command that he does not
know how to execute.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Two years later Surrey was in command of the
English forces at Boulogne, there suffered defeat,
and was, though not as an ostensible result of his
failure, superseded by his rival and enemy, the Earl
of Hertford, brother of the Admiral and head of
the Seymour clan.</p>

<p>Such was the record of the man who was
to fall a prey to the malice and jealousy of the
opposite party in the State. His noble birth, his
long descent, and his brilliant gifts, were so many
causes tending to make him hated and feared;
besides which, even amongst men in whom humility
was a rare virtue, he was noted for his pride&mdash;“the
most foolish, proud boy,” as he was once described,
“that is in England.” When he came to be tried
for his life those of his own house came forward
to bear witness to the contempt he had displayed
towards inferiors in rank, if not in power. “These
new men,” he had said scornfully&mdash;it was his sister
who played the part of his accuser&mdash;“these new men
loved no nobility, and if God called away the King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
they should smart for it.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> None of the King’s
Council, he was reported to have declared, loved
him, because they were not of noble birth, and also
because he believed in the Sacrament of the Altar.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>In verse he had likewise made his sentiments
clear, comparing himself, much to his advantage,
with the men he hated.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>It was a natural and inevitable consequence of his
attitude towards them that the “new men” hated
and sought the ruin of the poet who held them up
publicly to scorn; and if his great popularity in the
country was in some sort a shield, it was also calculated
to prove perilous, by giving rise to suspicion
and distrust on the part of a sovereign prone to
indulge in these sentiments, and thereby to render
the success of his foes more easy.</p>

<p>The Seymours were aware that their time was short.
With the King’s approaching death the question of
the guardianship of the successor to the throne was
becoming daily more momentous; and when pride
and vanity on the part of the Earl, together with
treachery on that of friends and kin, placed a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
weapon in the hands of his opponents, they were
prompt to use it.</p>

<p>During the summer there was nothing to serve as
a presage of his fate; and so late as August he took
part in the magnificent reception accorded to the French
ambassadors, successfully vindicating on that occasion
his right to precedence over the Earl of Hertford,
with whom he was as usual at open enmity.</p>

<p>A new cause of quarrel had been added to the old.
The Duke of Norfolk, developing, as age crept upon
him, an unwonted desire for peace and amity, had
lately devised a method of terminating the feud
between his heir and the Seymour brothers, so
powerful, by reason of their kinship to Prince
Edward, in the State. Not only had he revived a
project for uniting his widowed daughter, the Duchess
of Richmond, to Thomas Seymour, Lord Admiral,
Katherine Parr’s former lover, but had made a further
proposal to cement the alliance between the rival
houses by marrying three of his grandchildren to
Hertford’s children.</p>

<p>The old man’s scheme was not destined to succeed.
Whether or not the Seymours would have consented
to forget ancient grudges, Surrey remained
irreconcilable, flatly refusing his consent to his father’s
plan. So long as he lived, he declared, no son of
his should ever wed Lord Hertford’s daughter; and
when his sister&mdash;perhaps not insensible to Thomas
Seymour’s attractions&mdash;showed an inclination to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
yield to the Duke’s wishes, he addressed bitter taunts
to her. Since Seymour was in favour with the
King, he told her ironically, let her conclude the
farce of a marriage, and play in England the part
which had, in France, belonged to the Duchesse
d’Étampes, Francis I.’s mistress.</p>

<p>Mary Howard did not marry the Admiral, but,
possibly sharing her brother’s pride, she never forgot
or forgave the insult he had offered her; and,
repeating the sarcasm as if it had been advice
tendered in all seriousness, did her best to damn
the Earl in his day of extremity. In a contemporary
Spanish chronicle further particulars, true
or false, of the quarrel are added. It is there
related that, grieved at the tales that had reached
him of his sister’s lightness of conduct, Surrey had
taken upon himself to administer a brotherly rebuke.</p>

<p>“Sister,” he said, “I am very sorry to hear what
I do about you; and if it be true, I will never speak
to you again, but will be your mortal enemy.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>The Duchess was not a woman to accept the
admonition meekly, and it was she who was to prove,
in the sequel, the more dangerous foe of the two.</p>

<p>The offence for which Surrey nominally suffered
the capital penalty seems trivial enough. According
to the story told by contemporary authorities&mdash;and
it suits well with his overweening pride in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
his ancient blood and royal descent&mdash;he caused a
painting to be executed wherein the Norfolk arms
were joined to those of the royal house, the motto
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Honi soit qui mal y pense</i> being replaced by the enigmatical
device <em>Till then thus</em>, and the whole concealed
by a canvas placed above it.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>HENRY HOWARD, EARL OF SURREY.</p></div></div>

<p>The very fact of the secrecy observed betrays the
Earl’s consciousness that he had committed an imprudence.
He was guilty of a worse when, notwithstanding
the terms upon which he stood with
his sister, he made her his confidant in the matter.
The Duchess, in her turn, informed her father of
what had been done, but to the Duke’s remonstrances
Surrey turned a deaf ear. His ancestors, he replied,
had borne these arms, and he was much better than
they. Powerless to move him, his father, reiterating
his fears that it might furnish occasion for a charge
of treason, begged that the affair might be kept
strictly private, to which Surrey readily agreed.
Both men, however, had reckoned without the
woman who was daughter to the one, sister to the
other. Whether, as some aver,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> the Duchess took
the step of betraying her brother directly to the King,
or merely corroborated the accusations preferred
against him by others&mdash;Sir Richard Southwell, a
friend of Surrey’s childhood, being the first to denounce
him<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>&mdash;the matter soon became known, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Earl was examined at length, and by the middle of
December was, with his father, lodged in the Tower
on the charge of treason, the assumption of the
royal arms being viewed as an implied claim to the
succession to the throne, and as a menace to the little
heir. Hertford and his brother were at hand to
exaggerate the peril to be feared from his ambition;
and the affection of the populace, who, as he was
taken through the city to his place of captivity, made
great lamentation,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> was not fitted to allay apprehension.
A month later the Earl’s trial took place
at the Guildhall, crowds filling the streets as he
went by. Brought before his judges, he made so
spirited a defence that Holinshed admits that “if
he had tempered his answers with such modesty as
he showed token of a right perfect and ready wit,
his praise had been the greater”; and though neither
wit nor modesty was likely to avail to save him,
it was not without long deliberation that the jury
agreed to declare him guilty.</p>

<p>Their verdict was pronounced by his implacable
enemy, Hertford; being greeted by the people with
“a great tumult, and it was a long while before they
could be silenced, although they cried out to them
to be quiet.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The prisoner received what was practically
sentence of death in characteristic fashion. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
enemies might have vanquished him, but he could
still despise them, still assert his inborn superiority
to his victors.</p>

<p>“Of what have you found me guilty?” he
demanded. “Surely you will find no law that
justifies you; but I know that the King wants to
get rid of the noble blood around him, and to
employ none but low people.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>On January 19, not a week after his trial, the poet,
King Henry VIII.’s latest victim, was beheaded on
Tower Hill. It was not the fault of Henry’s advisers
that his aged father did not follow him to the grave.
To have cleared Surrey out of their path was much;
but it was not enough. The Duke’s heir gone,
there were many eager to share amongst themselves
the Norfolk spoils; Henry was ready to send his
old servant to join his son; and only the King’s
death, on the very night before the day appointed
for the Duke’s execution, saved him from sharing
Surrey’s fate. On January 28, 1547, nine days after
the Earl had been slain, Henry was dead.</p>

<p>The end can have taken few people by surprise.
Whether it was unexpected by the King none can
tell. His will was made&mdash;a will paving the way
for the misfortunes of one of his kin, and preparing
the scaffold upon which Lady Jane Grey was
to die; since, tacitly setting aside the claims of his
elder sister, Margaret of Scotland, and her heirs, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
provided that, after his own children, Edward, Mary,
and Elizabeth, the descendants of Mary Tudor, of
whom Jane was, in the younger generation, the representative,
should stand next in the order of succession
to the throne. It was the first occasion upon which
Lady Jane’s position had been explicitly defined,
and was the prelude of the tragedy that was to
follow. Should the unrepealed statutes declaring
the King’s daughters illegitimate be permitted in the
future to weigh against his present provisions in
their favour, his great niece or her mother would,
in the event of Prince Edward’s death, become heirs
to the crown.</p>

<p>For Henry the opportunity of cancelling, had it
been possible, the injustices of a lifetime was over.
“Soon after the death of the Earl of Surrey,”
writes the Spanish chronicler, “the King felt unwell;
and, as he was a wise man, he called his
council together, and said to them, ‘Gentlemen, I am
unwell, and cannot tell when God may call me, so
I wish to put my soul in order, and to reward my
servants for what they have done.’”</p>

<p>The writer was probably drawing upon his imagination,
and presenting rather a picture of what, in
his opinion, ought to have taken place than of what
truly happened. It quickly became patent to all
that the end was at hand; but, though the physicians
represented to those about the dying man that it
was fitting that he should be warned of his condition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
most of them shrank from the task. At length Sir
Anthony Denny took the performance of the duty
upon himself, exhorting his master boldly to prepare
for death, “calling himself to remembrance of
his former life, and to call upon God in Christ
betimes for grace and mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>What followed must again be largely matter of
conjecture, the various accounts being coloured
according to the theological views of the narrator.
It is possible that, feeling the end near, and calling
to mind, as Denny bade him, the life he had led,
Henry may have been visited by one of those deathbed
repentances so mercilessly described by Raleigh:
“For what do they do otherwise that die this kind
of well-dying, but say to God as followeth: We
beseech Thee, O God, that all the falsehoods, forswearings,
and treacheries of our lives past may be
pleasing unto Thee; that Thou wilt, for our sakes
(that have had no leisure to do anything for Thine)
change Thy nature (though impossible) and forget
to be a just God; that Thou wilt love injuries and
oppressions, call ambition wisdom, and charity foolishness.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
Into the secrets of the deathbed none can
penetrate. Some say the King’s remorse, for the
execution of Anne Boleyn in particular, was genuine;
others that he was haunted by visionary fears and
terrors. In the Spanish chronicle quoted above, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
is asserted that, sending for “Madam Mary,” his
injured daughter, he confessed that fortune&mdash;he
might have said himself&mdash;had been hard against
her, that he grieved not to have married her as he
wished, and prayed her further to be a mother to
the Prince, “for look, he is very little yet.”</p>

<p>The same authority has also drawn what one
must believe to be an imaginary picture of a final
and affecting interview between Katherine and her
husband, “when the good Queen could not answer
for weeping.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> His account is uncorroborated by
other evidence, and it is impossible to believe that
she can have felt genuine sorrow for the death of a
man whose life was a perpetual menace to her own.</p>

<p>According to Foxe, when Denny, the courageous
servant who had warned him of his danger, asked
whether he would see no learned divine, the King
replied that, were any such to be called, it should
be Cranmer, but him not yet. He would first sleep,
and then, according as he felt, would advise upon
the matter. When, an hour or two later, finding
his weakness increasing, he sent for the Archbishop,
it was too late for speech. “Notwithstanding ...
he, reaching his hand to Dr. Cranmer, did hold him
fast,” and, desired by the latter to give some token
of trust in God, he “did wring his hand in his as
hard as he could, and so, shortly after, departed.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">With</span> the death of the King a change, complete
and sudden, passed over the face of
affairs. So long as Henry drew breath all was
uncertain; security there was none. The men who
were in favour to-day might be disgraced to-morrow,
and with regard to the government of the country
and the guardianship of the new sovereign all
depended upon the state of mind in which death
might find him. Happening when it actually did,
it left the “new men,” the objects of Surrey’s
contempt, triumphant. Norfolk was in prison on
a capital charge; his son was dead. Gardiner had
fallen into disgrace at the same time as the Howards,
and, though averting a worse fate by a timely show
of submission, had never regained his power, his
name being omitted by Henry from the list of his
executors, all, with the exception of Wriothesley
the Chancellor, adherents of the Seymours and for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
most part pledged to the support of the Protestant
interest. Henry had acted deliberately.</p>

<p>“My Lord of Winchester&mdash;I think by negligence&mdash;is
left out of Your Majesty’s will,” said Sir
Anthony Browne, kneeling by the King’s side, and
recalling to the dying man the Bishop’s long service
and great abilities. But Henry refused to reconsider
the question.</p>

<p>“Hold your peace,” he returned. “I remembered
him well enough, and of good purpose have left him
out; for surely, if he were in my testament, and one
of you, he would cumber you all, and you should
never rule him, he is of so troublesome a nature.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Gardiner removed, there was no one left of
sufficient influence to combat the Seymours. Their
day was come.</p>

<p>The King’s death had taken place on Friday,
January 28. The Council, for reasons of their own,
kept the news secret until the following Monday,
when, amidst a scene of strong emotion, real or
simulated, the fact was made known to Lords and
Commons, Parliament was dissolved, and the Commons
dismissed, the peers staying in London to
welcome their new sovereign. On February 1 a fresh
and crowning success was scored by the dominant
party, and Hertford&mdash;Wriothesley’s being the sole
dissentient voice in the governing body&mdash;was made
Protector and guardian of the King. That afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Edward received the homage of the Lords spiritual
and temporal, and the new reign was inaugurated.</p>

<p>On the 20th of the same month the coronation
took place with all magnificence. On the previous
day the nine-year-old King had been brought
“through his city of London in most royal and
goodly wise” to Westminster, the crafts standing
on one side of the streets to see him pass, priests
and clerks on the other, with crosses and censers,
waiting to cense the new sovereign as he went by.
The sword of state was borne by Dorset, as
Constable of England, and his daughter, the same
age as the King, was probably a witness of the
splendid pageant and watched her cousin as, in his
gown of cloth of silver embroidered in gold and with
his white velvet jerkin and cape, he rode through the
city.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>At the coronation on the following day Dorset
again occupied a prominent place, standing by the
King and carrying the sceptre, Somerset bearing the
crown. Cranmer, with no longer anything to fear
from his enemies, performed the ceremony and delivered
an address that can have left no doubt in the
minds of any of his hearers, if such there were, who
had clung to the hope that a moderate policy would
be pursued in ecclesiastical matters, of what was to
be expected from the men who had in their hands
the little head of Church and State. As God’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Vice-regent and Christ’s Vicar, Edward Tudor was
exhorted to see that God was worshipped, idolatry
destroyed, the tyranny of the Bishop of Rome
banished, and images removed, the hybrid ceremony
being concluded by a solemn high mass, Cranmer
acting as celebrant.</p>

<p>Signal success had attended the inauguration of
the new régime. Dissentients were almost nonexistent.
Wriothesley, now Earl of Southampton,
remained the solitary genuine adherent of the old
faith belonging to the Council. His lack of caution
in putting the great seal into commission without the
authority of his colleagues afforded them an excuse
for ousting him from his post of Chancellor; he was
compelled to resign his office, and received orders to
confine himself to his house, whilst Hertford, become
Duke of Somerset, took advantage of his absence
to obtain letters patent by which he became virtually
omnipotent in the State.</p>

<p>The earlier months of his government were
chiefly devoted to carrying through drastic measures
of ecclesiastical reform, in which he was aided by
conviction in some, and cupidity in others, of his
colleagues, eager to benefit by the spoliation of the
Church. With the education of the King in the
hands of the Protector, they could count upon
immunity when he should come to an age to execute
justice on his own account, and the work went
swiftly forward. Gardiner, it was true, offered a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
determined opposition. If he had pandered to his
old master, he vindicated his character for courage
by braving the resentment of the men now in power,
and paid for his boldness by imprisonment.</p>

<p>By September the internal affairs of the kingdom
were on a sufficiently settled footing to allow the
Protector to turn his attention to Scotland. Crossing
the border with an army of twenty thousand men, he
conducted in person a short campaign ending with
the victory of Pinkie, after which, to the surprise of
those who expected to see him follow up his success,
he hurried home.</p>

<p>His hasty retreat was ascribed to different causes.
Some supposed him eager to be again at his post,
with the prestige of his victory still fresh. By
others it was imagined that he feared the intrigues
of his enemies, and in especial of his brother the
Admiral. Nor would such uneasiness have been without
justification. So long as their combined strength
was necessary to enable them to stand against
their enemies, the two had made common cause.
Somerset was popular in the country; the nobles
preferred the Admiral. For both a certain distrust
was entertained by those who felt that “their new
lustre did dim the light of men honoured with ancient
nobility.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>” The consciousness of insecurity kept
them at one with each other. Become all-powerful
in the State, jealousy and passion sundered them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Ambitious, proud, and resentful of the Duke’s
assumption of undivided authority, Seymour had
quickly shown an intention of undermining his
brother’s position in the country, with his hold
upon the King, and the Protector may reasonably
have felt that it was neither safe nor politic, so far
as his personal interest was concerned, to remain too
long at a distance from the centre of government.</p>

<p>To the jealousies natural to ambitious men
other causes of dissension had been added. These
were due to the position achieved by Seymour some
months previous to the Scotch campaign by his
marriage with the King’s widow.</p>

<p>The conduct of Katherine at this juncture is
allowed by her warmest partisans to furnish matter
for regret. Little information is forthcoming concerning
her movements at the time of the King’s
death; nor does any blame attach to her if she
regarded that event in the light of a timely release,
an emancipation from a condition of perpetual unrest
and anxiety. In any case the age was not one
when overmuch time was squandered in mourning,
real or conventional, for the dead; and, judging
by the sequel, it is possible that, even before the
final close was put to her married life, she may
have been contemplating the recovery of her lost
lover. It is said that when the Lord Admiral paid
her his formal visit of condolence she not only
received him in private, but candidly confessed how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
slight was her reason to regret a man who had
done her the wrong of appropriating her youth.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>If the conversation is correctly reported, Seymour
would augur well of the Queen’s willingness, so far as
was possible, to make up for lost time. But he was
not himself inclined to be hurried. Intent upon
securing every means within his power to assist him
in the coming struggle for pre-eminence, he did
not at once convince himself that it was his best
policy to become the husband of the King’s step-mother,
and that a more advantageous alliance was
not within his grasp.</p>

<p>Other matters were also occupying his attention;
and it was now that Lady Jane Grey, unfortunately
a factor of importance in the political world, was
brought prominently forward and that her small
figure comes first into view in connection with the
competition for power and influence.</p>

<p>Although allied with the royal house, and in a
position to share in some sort Surrey’s contempt
for the parvenu nobility of whom the Seymours were
representative, Dorset and the King’s uncles, agreed
upon the crucial matter of religion, were on good
terms; and Henry was no sooner dead than it
occurred to the Admiral that he might steal a march
upon his brother and secure to himself a point of
vantage in the contest between them, by obtaining
the custody for the present, and the disposal in the
future, of the marquis’s eldest daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
He lost no time in attempting to compass his
purpose. Immediately after the late King’s death&mdash;according
to statements made when, at a later
date, Seymour had fallen upon evil times&mdash;Lord
Dorset received a visit from a dependant of the
Admiral’s, named Harrington, and the negotiations
ending in the transference of the practical guardianship
of the child to Seymour were set on foot.</p>

<p>Harrington was, it would seem, the bearer of a
letter from his master, containing the proposal that
Lady Jane should be committed to his care; and
found the Marquis, on this first occasion, “somewhat
cold” in the matter. The messenger, however,
proceeded to urge the wishes of his principal,
supporting them by arguments well calculated to
appeal to an ambitious man. He reported that he
had heard Seymour say “that Lady Jane was as
handsome as any lady in England, and that, if
the King’s Majesty, when he came of age, would
marry within the realm, it was as likely he would
be there as in any other place, and that he [the
Admiral] would wish it.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Such was Harrington’s deposition. Dorset’s
account of the interview is to much the same
effect. Visiting him at his house at Westminster
“immediately after the King’s death,” he stated
that Seymour’s envoy had advised him to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
content that his daughter should be with the
Admiral, assuring him that he would find means
to place her in marriage much to his comfort.</p>

<p>“With whom?” demanded Dorset, plainly anxious
to obtain an explicit pledge.</p>

<p>“Marry,” answered Harrington, “I doubt not
you shall see him marry her to the King.”</p>

<p>As a consequence of this conversation Dorset
called upon the Admiral at Seymour House a week
later, and as the two walked in the garden an
agreement was arrived at, and her father was won
over to send for the child, who thereafter remained
in the Admiral’s house “continually” until the
death of the Queen.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>It was a strange arrangement; the more so that
it was evidently concluded before the marriage of
the late King’s widow to Seymour, a man one would
imagine to have been in no wise fit to be entrusted
with the sole guardianship of the little girl. But
Dorset was ambitious; the favour of the King’s
uncle, with the possibility of securing the King
himself as a son-in-law, was not lightly to be forgone;
and the sacrifice of Jane was made, not for the last
time, to her father’s interest.</p>

<p>To the child herself the change from the Bradgate
fields and parks to the London home of her new
guardian must have been abrupt. Yet, though she
may have felt bewildered and desolate in her new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
surroundings and separated from her two little
sisters, her training at home had not been of a
description to cause her overmuch regret at a parting
from those responsible for it. It has been said that
every child should dwell for a time within an Eden
of its own, and with many men and women the
recollection of the unclouded irrational joy belonging
to a childhood surrounded by love and tenderness
may have constituted in after years a pledge and
a guarantee that happiness is possible, and that, in
spite of sin and sorrow and suffering, the world is
still, as God saw it at creation, very good. The
garden in which little Jane’s childhood was passed
was one of a different nature. “No lady,” says
Fuller pitifully, “which led so many pious, lived so
few pleasant days, whose soul was never out of the
nonage of affliction till Death made her of full years
to inherit happiness, so severe her education.” Her
father’s house was to her a house of correction.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>Such being the case, the less regret can have
mingled with the natural excitement of a child
brought into wholly new conditions of life, and
treated perhaps for the first time as a person of
importance. Nor was it long before circumstances
provided her with a home to which no exception
could be taken. By June Seymour’s marriage
with the Queen-Dowager had been made public.</p>

<p>In the interval, short though it was, that elapsed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
between the King’s death and the union of his
widow and the Admiral, Seymour had had time,
before committing himself to a renewal of his suit to
Katherine, to attempt a more brilliant match. Henry
had been scarcely a month dead before he addressed
a letter, couched in the correct terms of conventional
love-making, to the Princess Elizabeth, now fourteen.
He wished, he wrote, that it were possible to
communicate to the missive the virtue of rousing in
her heart as much favour towards him as his was full
of love for her, proceeding to pay the customary
tribute to the beauty and charm, together with
“a certain fascination I cannot resist,” by which he
had been subjugated.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, at fourteen, was keen-witted enough
to estimate aright the advantages offered by a
marriage with the uncle of the reigning sovereign.
Nor was she, perhaps, judging by what followed,
indifferent to the personal attractions of this, her
first suitor. Though a certain impression of
vulgarity is conveyed, in spite of his magnificent
voice and splendid appearance, by the Lord Admiral,
a child twenty years younger than himself was not
likely to detect, in the recognised Adonis of the
Court, the presence of this somewhat indefinable
attribute. In her eyes he was doubtless a dazzling
figure; and though she replied by a polite refusal to
entertain his addresses, it is said that she afterwards
owed her step-mother a grudge for having discouraged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
her from accepting them. Her answer was, however,
a model of maidenly modesty. She had, she
stated, neither age nor inclination to think of
marriage, and would never have believed that the
subject would have been broached so soon after her
father’s death. Two years at least must be passed
in mourning, nor could she decide to become a wife
before she had reached years of discretion.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>That problematical date would not be patiently
awaited by a man intent upon building up without
delay the fabric of his fortunes; and, denied
the late King’s daughter, Seymour promptly fell
back upon his wife. A graphic account of the
beginning of his courtship is supplied by the Spanish
chronicle, and, if not reliable for accuracy, the
narrative no doubt represents what was believed in
London, where the writer was resident. The
question of the marriage had been, according to
him, first mooted to the Council by the Protector,
and though other authorities assert that the Duke
was opposed to the match, both facts may be true.
It is not inconceivable that, whilst he would have
preferred that his brother should have looked less
high for a wife, the possibility that Seymour might
have obtained the hand of the King’s sister may
have caused the Protector to regard with favour an
arrangement putting a marriage with the Princess
out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
At the Council Board it is said that the proposal
received the approbation of the Chancellor. Cranmer,
though characterising it as an act of disrespect to the
memory of the late King, promised to interpose no
obstacle. Paget, the Secretary, went further, engaging
that his wife, in attendance on the Queen, should
push the matter to the best of her ability.</p>

<p>After dinner one day, accordingly&mdash;to continue
the narrative of the Spaniard&mdash;when the Queen, with
all her ladies, was in the great hall of the palace, and
the Lord Admiral entered, “looking so handsome
that every one had something to say about him,”
Lady Paget, taking her opportunity, made a whispered
inquiry to the Queen as to her opinion
of Seymour’s appearance. To which the Queen
answered that she liked it very much&mdash;“oh, how
changeable,” sighs the chronicler, “are women in that
country!” Encouraged by Katherine’s reply, Lady
Paget ventured to go further, and to hint at a
marriage; answering, when the Queen replied by
demurring on the score of her superior rank as
Queen-Dowager, that to win so pretty a man you
might well stoop. Katherine would, she added,
continue to retain her royal title.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>The Queen did not prove difficult to persuade.
If it is true that she had been cognisant of Seymour’s
attempt to obtain the hand of her step-daughter, the
fact might have warned her of the nature of the love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
he was offering to herself. But a woman in her
state of mind is not accessible to reason. A little
more than a month after Henry’s death the betrothal
took place, the marriage following upon it in May,
and the haste displayed giving singular proof of how
far the Queen’s old passion had mastered prudence
and discretion. The world was scandalised, and the
King’s daughters in particular were strong in their
disapproval; Mary, the more energetic of the two
on this occasion, summoning her sister to visit her,
that together they might devise means of preventing
the impending insult to their father’s memory,
or concert a method of making their attitude
clear.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, though her objections to the match
were probably, on personal grounds, stronger than
those of her sister, was more cautious than Mary.
The girl, or her advisers, may have been aware of
the fact that opposition to the King’s uncle would
be a dangerous course to be pursued by any one
whose future was as ill assured as her own; and,
in answer to her sister, she pointed out, though
expressing her grief at the affair, that their sole consolation
would lie in submission to the will of
Providence, since neither was able to offer practical
resistance to the project. Dissimulation, under these
circumstances, would be their best policy. Mary
might decline to visit the Queen, but in Elizabeth’s
subordinate position she would herself be compelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to do so, her step-mother having shown her so
much kindness.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Despite public censure, despite the blame and
disapproval of critics whose disapproval would carry
more weight, Katherine may not at this time have
regretted her defiance of conventional propriety;
and those spring weeks, passed at her jointure palace
in Chelsea, were probably the happiest of her
life. The nightmare sense of insecurity, which can
never have been wholly laid to rest so long as Henry
lived, was removed; the price exacted for her royal
dignity had been paid, to the uttermost farthing;
and she was a free woman. Her old love for
Seymour had re-awakened in full force, and she
believed it was returned. Pious and prudent,
Katherine had forgotten to be wise. Disillusionment
might come later, but at present the future smiled
upon her; and she may fairly have counted upon
it to pay, at long last, the debts of the past.</p>

<p>Her letters, light and tender, grave and gay,
indicate her mood as she awaited the day when she
would take her place before the world as Seymour’s
wife. Whether a marriage had already taken place,
though kept private as a concession to public opinion,
or whether it was still to come, there were secret
meetings in the early spring mornings by the river,
when the town was scarcely awake, the more welcome,
it may be, because of the sense that they were stolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
“When it shall be your pleasure to repair hither,”
wrote Kateryn the Quene&mdash;her invariable signature&mdash;to
her lover, “ye must take some pains to come
early in the morning, that ye may be gone again
by seven o’clock; and so I suppose ye may come
hither without suspect. I pray you let me have
knowledge over-night at what hour ye will come,
that your portress [herself] may wait at the gate of
the fields for you.... By her that is, and shall
be, your humble, true, and loving wife during her
life.”</p>

<p>Poor, learned Katherine had fallen an unresisting
victim, like any other common woman, to the gifts
and attractions of the man who was to prove so
unsatisfactory a husband!</p>

<p>By May 17, if not before, it is clear that the
marriage had taken place, though the secret had
been so closely kept that it was a surprise to the
bridegroom to discover that it was known to the
Queen’s own sister, Lady Herbert. On visiting
the latter, he told Katherine in a letter of this date,
she had charged him “touching my lodging with
your Highness at Chelsea,” the Admiral stoutly
maintaining that he had done no more than pass by
the garden on his way to the house of the Bishop
of London; “till at last she told me further tokens,
which made me change colour,” and he had arrived
at the conclusion that Lady Herbert had been taken
into her sister’s confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Meantime the inconvenience of the present condition
of things was evident; and to Mary&mdash;curiously
enough, since her disapproval of the projected marriage
had been so pronounced&mdash;Seymour applied
for help which should enable him to put an end
to it. Although he preserved the attitude of a
mere suitor for the Queen’s hand, it may be that
the Princess suspected that she was being consulted
after the event. Her answer was not encouraging.
Had the matter concerned her nearest kinsman and
dearest friend it would, she told the Admiral, stand
least with her poor honour than with any other
creature to meddle in the affair, considering whose
wife the Queen had lately been.</p>

<p>“If the remembrance of the King’s Majesty my
father ... will not suffer her to grant your suit,
I am nothing able to persuade her to forget the
loss of him who is, as yet, very rife in mine own
remembrance.” If, however, the Princess refused
the assistance he begged, she assured him that,
“wooing matters apart, wherein, being a maid, I
am nothing cunning,” she would be ready in other
things to serve him.</p>

<p>The young King, to whom recourse was next
had, was found more accommodating; and indeed
appears to have been skilfully convinced that it
was by his persuasions that his step-mother had
been induced to bestow her hand upon his uncle,
writing to thank the Queen for her gentle acceptation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of his suit. The boy, after Katherine’s death
and her husband’s disgrace, gave an account of the
methods used to obtain his intervention:</p>

<p>“The Lord Admiral came to me ... and desired
me to write a thing for him. I asked him what.
He said it was none ill thing; it is for the Queen’s
Majesty. I said if it were good the Lords would
allow it; if it were ill I would not write on it.
Then he said they would take it in better part if
I would write. I desired him to let me alone in
that matter. Cheke said afterwards to me, ‘Ye
were best not to write.’”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>The boy’s letter to the Queen proves that he had
subsequently yielded to his uncle’s request; and in
June the fact of the marriage became public property.</p>

<p>The progress of the love-affair will have been
watched with interest by the curious and jealous
eyes of Elizabeth, the half-grown girl, who, placed
by the Council under her step-mother’s care at
Chelsea, had ample opportunities of forming her
conclusions. Lady Jane Grey may, not improbably,
have been likewise a spectator of what was going
forward. There is no evidence to show whether it
was before or after the public avowal of the marriage
that she took up her residence under the Queen’s
roof. But, having obtained his point and gained
her custody, it is not unreasonable to imagine that
the Admiral may have found a child of ten an encumbrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
in his household, and have taken the
earliest opportunity of consigning her to Katherine’s
care.</p>

<p>A passive asset as she was in the political reckoning,
the debates concerning her guardianship must
have done something to bring home to her mind
the consciousness of her importance; and she
had doubtless been made well aware of her title
to consideration by the time that she became an
honoured inmate of the Lord Admiral’s house.
But concerning the details of her existence at this
date history is dumb, and we can but guess at
her attitude as, fresh from her country home, she
watched, under the roof of her new guardian in
Seymour Place, the life of the great city around;
or within the more tranquil precincts of Chelsea
Palace, with the broad river flowing past, shared
in the studies and pursuits of her cousin Elizabeth,
ready-witted, full of vitality, and already displaying
some of the traits marking the Queen of future
years.</p>

<p>Did the shadow of predestined and early death
single little Jane out from her companions? Like
the comrades of whom Maeterlinck tells, “children
of precocious death,” possessing no friends amongst
the playmates who were not about to die, did she
stand in some sort apart and separate, regarding
those around her with a grave smile? We build
up the unrecorded days of childhood from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
few short years that followed; and reading backwards,
and fitting the fragments of a life into its
place, we find it difficult to believe that Jane
Grey’s laughter rang like that of other undoomed
children through the pleasant Chelsea gardens,
that she shared with a whole heart in the games
of her playfellows, or that the strange seriousness
of her youth did not envelope the small,
sedate figure of the child.</p>

<span class="subhead">1547-1548</span>

<span class="subhead">Katherine Parr’s unhappy married life&mdash;Dissensions between the
Seymour brothers&mdash;The King and his uncles&mdash;The Admiral
and Princess Elizabeth&mdash;Birth of Katherine’s child, and her
death.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> belated idyll of love and happiness enjoyed
by “Kateryn the Quene” was of pitifully short
duration. During the first days of September 1548,
some fifteen months after the stolen marriage at
Chelsea, a funeral procession left Sudeley Castle,
and the body of the wife of the Lord Admiral
was carried forth to burial, Lady Jane Grey, his
ward, then in her twelfth year, acting as chief
mourner.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Jane had good cause to mourn, in other than
an official capacity. It is hard to believe that, had
Katherine Parr been living, the child she had cared
for and who had made her home under her roof,
would not have been saved from the doom destined
to overtake her not six years later.</p>

<p>Katherine’s dream had died before she did, and
the period of her marriage, short though it was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
must have been a time of rapid disillusionment.
It could scarcely, taking the circumstances into
account, have been otherwise. Seymour was not
the man to make the happiness of a wife touching
upon middle age, studious, learned, and devout,
“avoiding all occasions of idleness, and contemning
vain pastimes.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> His love, if indeed it had been ever
other than disguised ambition, was short-lived, and
Katherine’s awakening must have come all too swiftly.</p>

<p>Nor was the revelation of her husband’s true
character her only cause of trouble. Minor vexations
had, from the first, attended her new condition
of life, and she had been made to feel that the wife
of the Protector’s younger brother could not expect
to enjoy the deference due to a Dowager-Queen.
To Katherine, who clung to her former dignity, the
loss of it was no light matter, and her sister-in-law,
the Duchess of Somerset, and she were at open war.</p>

<p>Contemporary and early writers are agreed as
to the nature of the woman with whom she had
to deal. “The Protector,” explains the Spanish
chronicler, giving the popular version of the affair,
“had a wife who was prouder than he was, and she
ruled the Protector so completely that he did whatever
she wished, and she, finding herself in such
great state, became more presumptuous than
Lucifer.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Hayward attributes the subsequent
disunion between the brothers, in the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
to “the unquiet vanity of a mannish, or rather a
devilish woman ... for many imperfections
intolerable, but for pride monstrous”;<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> whilst
Heylyn represents the Duchess as observing that, if
Mr. Admiral should teach his wife no better manners,
“I am she that will.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>The struggle for precedence carried on between
the wives could scarcely fail to have a bad effect
upon the relationship of the husbands, already at
issue upon graver questions; and Warwick,
Somerset’s future rival, was at hand to foment
the strife between Protector and Admiral, and,
“secretly playing with both hands,” paved the
way for the fall of the younger brother and the
consequent weakening of the forces which barred
the way to the attainment of his personal ambitions.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>KATHERINE PARR.</p></div></div>

<p>Nor can there be any doubt that, apart from
the ill offices of those who desired to separate the
interests of the brothers, the Protector had good
reason to stand upon his guard. When Seymour
was tried for his life during the winter of 1548-9,
dependants and equals alike came forward to bear
witness to his intriguing propensities, their evidence
going far to prove that, whatever may be thought
of Somerset’s conduct as a brother in sending him to
the scaffold, as head of the State and responsible for
the government of the realm, he was not without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
justification. It is clear that from the first the
Admiral, jealous of the position accorded to the
Duke by the Council, had been sedulously engaged
in attempting to undermine his power, and had
not disguised his resentment at his appropriation
of undivided authority. Never had it been seen
in a minority&mdash;so he informed a confidant<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>&mdash;that
the one brother should bear all rule, the other
none. One being Protector, the other should
have filled the post of Governor to the King, so
he averred; although, on another occasion, contradicting
himself, he declared he would wish the
earth to open and swallow him rather than accept
either post. There was abundant proof that he
had done his utmost, whenever opportunity was
afforded him, to rouse the King to discontent.
It was a disagreeable feature of the day that men
were in no wise slack in accusing their friends in
times of disgrace, thereby seeking to safeguard their
reputations; and Dorset came forward later to
testify that Seymour had told him that his nephew
had divers times made his moan, saying that “My
uncle of Somerset dealeth very hardly with me, and
keepeth me so straight that I cannot have money at
my will.” The Lord Admiral, added the boy, both
sent him money and gave it to him.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant testimony brought
against the Admiral was that of the little King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
himself, who asserted that Seymour had charged
him with being “bashful” in his own affairs, asking
why he did not speak to bear rule as did other Kings.
“I said I needed not, for I was well enough,” the
boy replied on this occasion. At another time,
according to his confession, a conversation took
place the more grim from the simplicity of the
language in which it is recorded.</p>

<p>“Within these two years at least,” said Edward,
now eleven years old, “he said, ‘Ye must take upon
yourself to rule, and then ye may give your men
somewhat; for your uncle is old, and I trust he will
not live long.’ I answered it were better that he
should die.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>It was scarcely possible that the Protector should
not have been cognisant of a part at least of his
brother’s machinations; and he naturally, so far as
was possible, kept his charge from falling further
under the influence of his enemies. The young
King’s affection for his step-mother had been a
cause of disquiet to her brother-in-law and his
wife, care being taken to separate him from her
as much as was possible. So long as Katherine
remained in London it had been Edward’s habit to
visit her apartments unattended, and by a private
entrance. Familiar intercourse of this kind terminated
when she removed to a distance; and, so
far as the Lord Protector could ensure obedience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
little communication was permitted between the
two during the short time the Queen had to live.
The boy, however, was constant to old affection, and
used what opportunities he could to express it.</p>

<p>“If his Grace could get any spare time,” wrote
one John Fowler, a servant of the royal household,
to the Admiral, “his Grace would write
a letter to the Queen’s Grace, and to you. His
Highness desires your lordship to pardon him, for
his Grace is not half a quarter of an hour alone.
But in such leisure as his Grace has, his Majesty
hath written (here enclosed) his commendations to
the Queen’s Grace and to your lordship, that he is
so much bound to you that he must remember you
always, and, as his Grace may have time, you shall
well perceive by such small lines of recommendations
with his own hand.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The scribbled notes, on scraps of paper, written
by stealth and as he could find opportunity, by the
King, testify to the closeness of the watch kept
upon him; their contents show the means by which
the Admiral strove to maintain his hold upon his
nephew.</p>

<p>“My lord,” so runs the first, “send me, per
Latimer, as much as ye think good, and deliver it
to Fowler.” The second note is one of thanks.</p>

<p>An attempt was made by the Admiral to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
a letter from the King which, complaining of the
Protector’s system of restraint, should be laid before
Parliament; but the intrigue was discovered, the
Admiral summoned to appear before the Council,
and, though he was at first inclined to bluster, and
replied by a defiance, a hint of imprisonment brought
him to reason, and some sort of hollow reconciliation
between the brothers followed.</p>

<p>The King, the unfortunate subject of dispute, was
probably lonely enough. For his tutor, Sir John
Cheke, and for his school-mate, Barnaby Fitzpatrick,
he appears to have entertained a real affection; but
for his elder uncle and guardian he had little liking,
nor was the Duchess of Somerset a woman to win
the heart of her husband’s ward. From his step-mother
and the Admiral he was practically cut off;
and his sisters, for whom his attachment was genuine,
were at a distance, and paid only occasional visits to
Court. Mary’s influence, as a Catholic, would
naturally have been feared; and Elizabeth, living
for the time under the Admiral’s roof, would be
regarded likewise with suspicion. But the happiness
of the nominal head of the State was not a
principal consideration with those around him, mostly
engaged in a struggle not only to secure present
personal advantages, but to ensure their continuance
at such time as Edward should have attained his
majority.</p>

<p>The relations between the Seymour brothers being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
that of a scarcely disguised hostility, the Admiral had
the more reason to congratulate himself upon having
obtained the possession and disposal of the person
of Lady Jane Grey&mdash;third, save for her mother,
in the line of succession to the throne. Should her
guardian succeed in effecting her marriage with the
King the arrangement might prove of vital importance.
On the other hand, Somerset’s matrimonial
schemes for the younger members of the
royal house were of an altogether different nature.
He would have liked to marry the King to a daughter
of his own, another Lady Jane, and to have obtained
the hand of Lady Jane Grey for his son, young
Lord Hertford.</p>

<p>Such projects, however, belonged to the future.
Nothing could be done for the present, nor does it
appear that, when Somerset’s scheme afterwards
became known to the King, it met with any favour
in his eyes; since, noting it in his journal, he added
his private intention of wedding “a foreign princess,
well stuffed and jewelled.”</p>

<p>So far as Katherine was concerned, her domestic
affairs were probably causing her too much anxiety
to leave attention to spare for those of King or
kingdom, except as they were gratifying, or the
reverse, to her husband. Since the May day when
she had given herself, rashly and eagerly, into
the keeping of the Lord Admiral, she had been
sorrowfully enlightened as to the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
man and of his affection; and, if she still loved
him, her heart must often have been heavy. The
presence of the Princess Elizabeth under her roof
had been disastrous in its consequences; and,
though it was at first the interest of all to keep
the matter secret, the inquisition made at the time
of the Admiral’s disgrace into the circumstances
of his married life affords an insight into his wife’s
wrongs.</p>

<p>In a conversation held between Mrs. Ashley,
Elizabeth’s governess, and her cofferer, Parry, after
the Queen’s death, the possibility of a marriage
between the widower and the Princess was discussed,
Parry raising objections to the scheme, on the score
that he had heard evil of Seymour as being covetous
and oppressive, and also “how cruelly, dishonourably,
and jealously he had used the Queen.”</p>

<p>Ashley, from first to last eager to forward the
Admiral’s interests, brushed the protest aside.</p>

<p>“Tush, tush,” she replied, “that is no matter.
I know him better than ye do, or those that do so
report him. I know he will make but too much of
her, and that she knows well enough.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>The same witness confessed at this later date that
she feared the Admiral had loved the Princess too
well, and the Queen had been jealous of both&mdash;an
avowal corroborated by Elizabeth’s admissions,
when she too underwent examination concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
relations which had existed between herself and her
step-mother’s husband.</p>

<p>“Kat Ashley told me,” she deposed, “after the
Lord Admiral was married to the Queen, that if my
lord might have had his own will, he would have
had me, afore the Queen. Then I asked her how
she knew that. Then she said she knew it well
enough, both from himself and from others.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>If the correspondence quoted in a previous page is
genuine,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Elizabeth, though she may have had reason
to keep her knowledge to herself, can have been in
no doubt as to the Admiral’s sentiments at the time
of her father’s death. With a governess of Mrs.
Ashley’s type, a girl of fifteen such as Elizabeth
was shown to be by her subsequent career, and a
man like Seymour, it would not have been difficult
to prophesy trouble. That the Admiral was in
love with his wife’s charge may be doubted; in
the same way that ambition, rather than any other
sentiment, may be credited with his desire to obtain
her hand a few months earlier. What was certain
was that he amused himself, after his boisterous
fashion, with the sharp-witted girl to an extent calculated
to cause both uneasiness and anger to the
Queen. That no actual harm was intended may be
true&mdash;he could scarcely have been blind to the consequences
had he dared to deal otherwise with the
daughter and sister of Kings; and the whole story,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
when it subsequently came to light, reads like an
instance of coarse and vulgar flirtation, in harmony
with the nature of the man and the habits of the
times. What is less easy to account for is Katherine’s
partial connivance, in its earlier stages, at the rough
horse-play, if nothing worse, carried on by her
husband and her step-daughter. A scene, for
example, is described as taking place at Hanworth,
where the Admiral, in the garden with his wife and
the Princess, cut the girl’s gown, “being black cloth,”
into a hundred pieces; Elizabeth replying to Mrs.
Ashley’s protests by saying that “she could not
strive with all, for the Queen held her while the
Lord Admiral cut the dress.” Nor was this the
only occasion upon which Katherine appears to have
looked on without disapproval whilst her husband
treated her charge in a fashion befitting her character
neither as Princess nor guest.</p>

<p>The explanation may lie in the fact that the unfortunate
Queen was attempting to adapt her taste
and her manners to those of the man she had married.
But the condition of the household could not last.
A crisis was reached when one day Katherine, coming
unexpectedly upon the two, found Seymour with the
Princess in his arms, and decided, none too soon,
that an end must be put to the situation. It was
not long after that the households of Queen and
Princess were parted, “and as I remember,” explained
Parry the cofferer, “this was the cause why she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
sent from the Queen, or else that her Grace parted
from the Queen. I do not perfectly remember
whether of both she [Ashley] said she went of herself
or was sent away.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>There can be little doubt, one would imagine, that
it was Katherine who determined to disembarrass
herself of her visitor. A letter from Elizabeth, evidently
written after their separation, appears to show
that farewell had been taken in outwardly friendly
fashion, although the promise she quotes Katherine
as making has an ambiguous sound about it. The
Princess wrote to say that she had been replete in
sorrow at leaving the Queen, “and albeit I answered
little, I weighed it more deeply when you said you
would warn me of all evils that you should hear of
me; for if your Grace had not a good opinion of
me, you would not have offered friendship to me
that way, that all men judge the contrary.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult to detect the sore feeling underlying
Elizabeth’s acknowledgments of a promise of
open criticism. Katherine must have breathed more
freely when the Princess and her governess had
quitted the house.</p>

<p>Meantime, in spite of disappointment and anger
and care, the winter was to bring the Queen one
genuine cause of rejoicing. Thrice married without
children, she was hoping to give Seymour an heir,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
and the prospect was hailed with delight by husband
and wife alike. In her gladness, and the chief cause
of dissension removed, her just grounds of complaint
were forgotten; her letters continued to be couched
in terms as loving as if no domestic friction had
interrupted her wedded happiness, and she ranged
herself upon Seymour’s side in his recurrent disputes
with his brother with a passionate vehemence
out of keeping with her character.</p>

<p>“This shall be to advertise you,” she wrote some
time in 1548, “that my lord your brother hath
this afternoon made me a little warm. It was
fortunate we were so much distant, for I suppose
else I should have bitten him. What cause have
they to fear having such a wife! It is requisite for
them continually to pray for a dispatch of that hell.
To-morrow, or else upon Saturday ... I will see
the King, where I intend to utter all my choler to
my lord your brother, if you shall not give me
advice to the contrary.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>Another letter, also indicating the strained relations
existing between the brothers, is again full of affection
for the man who deserved it so ill.</p>

<p>“I gave your little knave your blessing,” she tells
the Admiral, alluding to the unborn child neither
parent was to see grow up, “... bidding my
sweetheart and loving husband better to fare than
myself.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
A few months more, and hope and fear and love
and disappointment were alike to find an end.
Sudeley Castle, where the final scene took place,
was a property granted to the Admiral on the death
of the late King, from which he took his title as Lord
Seymour of Sudeley. It was a question whether
those responsible for the government had the right
of alienating possessions of the Crown during the
minority of a sovereign, and the tenure upon which
the place was held was therefore insecure, Katherine
asserting on one occasion that it was her husband’s
intention to restore it to his nephew when he should
come of age. In awaiting that event Seymour and
his wife had the enjoyment of the beauty for which
the old building had long been noted.</p>

<p>“Ah, Sudeley Castle, thou art the traitor, not
I!” said one of its former lords as, arrested by the
orders of Henry IV. for treason, and taken away to
abide his trial, he cast a last look back at his home&mdash;a
possession worthy of being coveted by a King,
and by the attainder of its owner forfeited to the
Crown.</p>

<p>Here, during the summer of 1548&mdash;the last
Katherine was to see&mdash;a motley company gathered
round the Queen. Jane Grey, “the young and
early wise,” was still a member of her household,
and the repudiated wife of Katherine’s brother, the
Earl of Northampton&mdash;placed, it would seem, under
some species of restraint&mdash;was in the keeping of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
sister-in-law. Her true and tried friend, Lady
Tyrwhitt, described by her husband as half a Scripture
woman, kept her company, as she had done in her
perilous days of royal state. Learned divines, living
with her in the capacity of chaplains, were inmates
of the castle, charged with the duty of performing
service twice each day&mdash;exercises little to the taste
of the master of the house, who made no secret of
his aversion for them.</p>

<p>“I have heard say,” affirmed Latimer, in the
course of one of the sermons, preached after
Seymour’s execution, in which the Bishop took
occasion again and again to revile the dead man,
“I have heard say that when the good Queen that
is gone had ordained daily prayer in her house,
both before noon and after noon, the Admiral
getteth him out of the way, like a mole digging in
the earth. He shall be Lot’s wife to me as long as
I live.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>To Sudeley also had repaired, in the course of
the summer, Lord Dorset, possibly desirous of
assuring himself that all was well with his little
daughter. He may have had other objects in view.
According to his subsequent confession, Seymour
had discussed with him the methods to be pursued
in order to gain popularity in the country, making
significant inquiries as to the formation of the
marquis’s household.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Learning that Dorset had divers gentlemen who
were his servants, the Admiral admitted that it was
well. “Yet,” he added shrewdly, “trust not too
much to the gentlemen, for they have something
to lose”; proceeding to urge his ally to make much
of the chief yeomen and men of their class, who
were able to persuade the multitude; to visit them
in their houses, bringing venison and wine; to use
familiarity with them, and thus to gain their love.
Such, he added, was his own intention.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>Another inmate had been received at Sudeley
not more than a few weeks before Katherine’s confinement.
This was the Princess Elizabeth, who
appears, by a letter she addressed to the Queen when
the visit had been concluded, to have been at this
time again on terms of friendship and affection
with her step-mother, since writing to Katherine
with very little leisure on the last day of July, she
returned humble thanks for the Queen’s wish that
she should have remained with her “till she were
weary of that country.” Yet in spite of the
hospitable desire, she can scarcely have been a
welcome guest, and it must have been with little
regret that her step-mother saw her depart.</p>

<p>Meantime, the birth of the Queen’s child was
anxiously expected. Seymour characteristically desired
a son who “should God give him life to live
as long as his father, will avenge his wrongs”&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
problematical wrongs of a man who had risen to
his heights. Elizabeth, who had done her best to
wreck the Queen’s happiness and peace, was “praying
the Almighty God to send her a most lucky deliverance”;
and Mary, more sincere in her friendship,
wrote a letter full of affection to her step-mother.
The preparations made by Katherine for the new-comer
equalled in magnificence those that might
have befitted a Prince of Wales; and though the
birth of a girl, on August 30, must have been in
some degree a disappointment, she received a
welcome scarcely less warm than might have been
accorded to the desired son. A general reconciliation
appears to have taken place on the occasion, and
the Protector responded to the announcement of
the event in terms of cordial congratulation, regarding
the advent of so pretty a daughter in the
light of a “prophesy and good hansell to a great
sort of happy sons.”</p>

<p>Eight days after the rejoicings at the birth Katherine
was dead.</p>

<p>Into the circumstances attending her illness and
death close inquisition was made at a time when
it had become an object to throw discredit upon the
Admiral, and foul play&mdash;the use of poison&mdash;was
suggested. The charge was probably without
foundation; the facts elicited nevertheless afford
additional proof of the unsatisfactory relations existing
between husband and wife, and throw a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
melancholy light upon the closing scene of the
union from which so much had been hoped.</p>

<p>It was deposed by Lady Tyrwhitt, one of the
principal witnesses, that, upon her visiting the
chamber of the sick woman one morning, two days
before her death, Katherine had asked where she
had been so long, adding that “she did fear such
things in herself that she was sure she could not
live.” When her friend attempted to soothe her by
reassuring words, the Queen went on to say&mdash;holding
her husband’s hand and being, as Lady
Tyrwhitt thought, partly delirious&mdash;“I am not well
handled; for those that be about me care not for
me, but stand laughing at my grief, and the more
good I will to them the less good they will to me.”</p>

<p>The words, to those cognisant of the condition
of the household, must have been startling. The
Queen may have been wandering, yet her complaint,
as such complaints do, pointed to a truth. Others
besides Lady Tyrwhitt were standing by; and
Seymour made no attempt to ignore his wife’s
meaning, or to deny that the charge was directed
against himself.</p>

<p>“Why, sweet heart,” he said, “I would do you
no hurt.”</p>

<p>“No, my lord, I think not,” answered
Katherine aloud, adding, in his ear, “but, my
lord, you have given me many shrewd taunts.”</p>

<p>“These words,” said Lady Tyrwhitt in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
narrative, “I perceived she spake with good memory,
and very sharply and earnestly, for her mind was
sore disquieted.”</p>

<p>After consultation it was decided that Seymour
should lie down by her side and seek to quiet her
by gentle words; but his efforts were ineffectual, the
Queen interrupting him by saying, roundly and
sharply, “that she would have given a thousand
marks to have had her full talk with the doctor on
the day of her delivery, but dared not, for fear of
his displeasure.”</p>

<p>“And I, hearing that,” said the lady-in-waiting,
“perceived her trouble to be so great, that my heart
would serve me to hear no more.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Yet on that same day the dying Queen made
her will and, “being persuaded and perceiving the
extremity of death to approach her,” left all she
possessed to her husband, wishing it a thousand
times more in value than it was.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Whether pressure was used, or whether, in spite
of all, her old love awakened and stirred her to
kindness towards the man she was leaving, there
is nothing to show. But the names of the witnesses&mdash;Robert
Huyck, the physician attending her, and
John Parkhurst, her chaplain, afterwards a Bishop&mdash;would
seem a guarantee that the document, dictated
but not signed&mdash;no uncommon case&mdash;was genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
For the rest, Seymour was coarse and heartless, a
man of ambition, and intent upon the furtherance
of his fortunes. It is not unlikely that, when his
wife lay dying, his thoughts may have turned to
the girl to whom he had in his own way already
made love; who, of higher rank than the Queen,
might serve his interests better, and whom her
death would leave him free to win as his bride.
And Katherine, with the memories of the last two
years to aid her and with the intuitions born of
love and jealousy, may have divined his thoughts.
But of murder, or of hastening the end by actual
unkindness, there is no reason to suspect him. The
affair was in any case sufficiently tragic, and one
more mournful recollection to be stored in the
minds of those who had loved the Queen.</p>

<span class="subhead">1548</span>

<span class="subhead">Lady Jane’s temporary return to her father&mdash;He surrenders her
again to the Admiral&mdash;The terms of the bargain.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> of the secondary but immediate effects of
the Queen’s death was to send Lady Jane
Grey back to her parents. It was indeed to Seymour,
and not to his wife, that the care of the child had
been entrusted; but in his first confusion of mind
after what he termed his great loss, the Admiral
appears to have recognised the difficulty of providing
a home for a girl in her twelfth year in a house
without a mistress, and to have offered to relinquish
her to her natural guardians.</p>

<p>Having acted in haste, he was not slow to
perceive that he had committed a blunder, and
quickly reawakened to the importance of retaining
the possession and disposal of the child. On September
17, not ten days after Katherine’s death,
he was writing to Lord Dorset to cancel, so far as it
was possible, his hasty suggestion that she should
return to her father’s house, and begging that she
might be permitted to remain in his hands. In his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
former letter, he explained, he had been partly so
amazed at the death of the Queen as to have small
regard either to himself or his doings, partly had
believed that he would be compelled, in consequence
of it, to break up his household. Under these circumstances
he had suggested sending Lady Jane
to her father, as to him who would be most tender
of her. Having had time to reconsider the
question, he found that he would be in a position to
maintain his establishment much on its old footing.
“Therefore, putting my whole affiance and trust in
God,” he had begun to arrange his household as
before, retaining the services not only of the gentlewomen
of the late Queen’s privy chamber, but also
her inferior attendants. “And doubting lest your
lordship should think any unkindness that I should
by my said letter take occasion to rid me of your
daughter so soon after the Queen’s death, for the
proof both of my hearty affection towards you and
good will towards her, I mind now to keep her until
I shall next speak to your lordship ... unless I
shall be advertised from your lordship of your
express mind to the contrary.” His mother will,
he has no doubt, be as dear to Lady Jane as though
she were her daughter, and for his part he will
continue her half-father and more.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>It was clear that the Admiral would only yield the
point upon compulsion. Dorset, however, was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
disposed to accede to his wishes. Developing a
sudden parental anxiety concerning the child he had
been content to leave to the care of others for more
than eighteen months, he replied, firmly though
courteously negativing the Admiral’s request.</p>

<p>“Considering,” he said, “the state of my daughter
and her tender years wherein she shall hardly rule
herself as yet without a guide, lest she should, for
lack of a bridle, take too much the head and conceive
such opinion of herself that all such good behaviour
as she heretofore have learned by the Queen’s and
your most wholesome instruction, should either
altogether be quenched in her, or at the least much
diminished, I shall in most hearty wise require your
lordship to commit her to the governance of her
mother, by whom, for the fear and duty she owes
her, she shall be most easily ruled and framed towards
virtue, which I wish above all things to be most
plentiful in her.” Seymour no doubt would do his
best; but, being destitute of any one who should
correct the child as a mistress and monish her as a
mother, Dorset was sure that the Admiral would
think, with him, that the eye and oversight of his
wife was necessary. He reiterated his former
promise to dispose of her only according to Seymour’s
advice, intending to use his consent in that matter
no less than his own. “Only I seek in these her
young years, wherein she now standeth either to
make or mar (as the common saying is) the addressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of her mind to humility, soberness, and
obedience.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>It was the letter of a model parent, anxious
concerning the welfare, spiritual and mental, of a
beloved child, and Dorset, as he sealed and despatched
it, will have felt that policy and conscience were for
once in full accord. Lady Dorset likewise wrote,
endorsing her husband’s views.</p>

<p>“Whereas of a friendly and brotherly good will
you wish to have Jane, my daughter, continuing still
in your house, I give you most hearty thanks for
your gentle offer, trusting, nevertheless, that for the
good opinion you have in your sister [by courtesy,
meaning herself] you will be content to charge her
with her, who promiseth you not only to be ready
at all times to account for the ordering of your dear
niece, but also to use your counsel and advice on the
bestowing of her, whensoever it shall happen. Wherefore,
my good brother, my request shall be, that I
may have the oversight of her with your good will,
and thereby I shall have good occasion to think that
you do trust me in such wise as is convenient that a
sister be trusted of so loving a brother.”</p>

<p>The singular humility of the language used by
a king’s grand-daughter in demanding restitution of
her child is proof of the position held by the Admiral
in the eyes of those as well fitted to judge of it
as Dorset and his wife, only six months before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
he was sent to the scaffold. It was none the less
plain that they were determined to regain possession
of their daughter, and, though not abandoning the
hope of moving her parents from their purpose,
Seymour yielded provisionally to their will and sent
Lady Jane home. A letter from the small bone
of contention, dated October 1, thanking him for
his great goodness and stating that he had ever been
to her a loving and kind father, proves that her
removal had taken place by that time. The same
courier probably conveyed a letter from her mother,
making her acknowledgments for Seymour’s kindness
to the child, and his desire to retain her, and
adding an ambiguous hope that at their next meeting
both would be satisfied.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The Admiral, at all events, intended to obtain
satisfaction. Where his interest was concerned
he was an obstinate man. Notwithstanding his
apparent acquiescence, he meant to retain the custody
of Lord Dorset’s daughter, and he did so. Even
his household understood that the concession made
in sending her home was but temporary; and, in
a conversation with another dependant, Harrington&mdash;the
same who had served his master as go-between
before&mdash;observed that he thought the maids were
continuing with the Admiral in the hope of Lady
Jane’s return.</p>

<p>A visit paid by Seymour to Dorset decided the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
question. “In the end”&mdash;it is the latter who
speaks&mdash;“after long debating and much sticking
of our sides, we did agree that my daughter should
return.” The Admiral had come to his house, and
had been so earnest in his persuasions that he could
not resist him. The old bait had been once again
held out&mdash;Lady Jane, if Seymour could compass it,
was to marry the King. Her mother was wrought
upon till her consent was gained to a second
parting; and when this was the case, observed
the marquis, throwing, according to precedent, the
responsibility upon his wife, it was impossible for
him to refuse his own. He added a pledge that,
“except the King,” he would spend life and blood
for Seymour. Thus the alliance between the two
was renewed and cemented. A further item in the
transaction throws an additional and unpleasant light
upon the means taken to ensure the Lord Marquis’s
surrender.</p>

<p>The Admiral was a practical man, and knew with
whom he had to deal. He had not confined himself
to vague pledges, which Dorset knew as well as he
did that he might never be in a position to fulfil.
He had accompanied his promises by a gift of hard
cash. “Whether, as it were, for an earnest penny
of the favour that he would show unto him when
the said Lord Marquis had sent his daughter to the
said Lord Admiral, he sent the said Lord Marquis
immediately £500, parcell of £2,000 which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
promised to lend unto him and would have asked
no bond of him at all for it, but only to leave the
Lord Marquis’s daughter for a gage.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>Five hundred golden arguments, and more to
follow, were found irresistible by the needy Dorset.
The pressing necessity that Jane should be under
her mother’s eye disappeared; the bargain was
struck, and the guardianship of the child bought
and sold.</p>

<p>The Admiral was triumphant. It was not only
the point of vantage implied by the possession of
the little ward which he had feared to forfeit, but
that his loss might be the gain of his brother and
rival. There would be much ado for my Lady
Jane, he told his brother-in-law, Northampton, and
my Lord Protector and my Lady Somerset would
do what they could to obtain her yet for my Lord
of Hertford, their son. They should not, however,
prevail therein, for my Lord Marquis had given her
wholly to him, upon certain covenants between them
two. “And then I asked him,” said Northampton,
describing the conversation, “what he would do
if my Lord Protector, handling my Lord Marquis
of Dorset gently, should obtain his good will and
so the matter to lie wholly in his own neck? He
answered he would never consent thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>Thus Lady Jane was, for the first time, made
an instrument of obtaining that of which her father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
stood in need. On this occasion it was money;
on the next her life was to be staked upon a more
desperate hazard. In future she appears and disappears,
now in sight, now passing behind the scenes,
against the dark background of intrigue and hatred
and bloodshed belonging to her times.</p>

<span class="subhead">Seymour and the Princess Elizabeth&mdash;His courtship&mdash;He is sent
to the Tower&mdash;Elizabeth’s examinations and admissions&mdash;The
execution of the Lord Admiral.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> matter of Jane’s guardianship satisfactorily
settled, Seymour turned his attention to one
concerning him yet more intimately. He was a
free man, and he meant to make use of his freedom.
As after the death of Henry, so now when fate rendered
the project once more possible, he determined
to attempt to obtain the Princess Elizabeth as his
wife. The history of the autumn, as regarding
him, is of his continued efforts to increase his
power and influence in the country and to win
the hand of the King’s sister. Again the contemporary
Spanish chronicler supplies a popular
summary of the affair which, inaccurate as it is, is
useful in showing how his scheme was regarded by
the public.</p>

<p>According to this dramatic account of his proceedings,
the Admiral went boldly before the Council;
observed that, as uncle to the King, it was fitting
that he should marry honourably; and that, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
formerly been husband to the Queen, it would not
be much more were he to be accorded Madam
Elizabeth, whom he deserved better than any other
man. Referred by the Lords of the Council to the
Protector, he is represented as approaching the
Duke with the modest request that he might be
granted not only Elizabeth as his bride, but also the
custody of the King.</p>

<p>“When his brother heard this, he said he would
see about it.” Calling the Council together, he
repeated to them the demand made by the Admiral
that his nephew should be placed in his hands;
continuing, as the Lords “looked at each other,”
that the matter must be well considered, since in his
opinion his brother could have no good intent in
asking first for the Princess, and then for the custody
of the King. “The devil is strong,” said the
Protector. “He might kill the King and Madam
Mary, and then claim the crown.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>Whilst this was the version of the Admiral’s
project current in the street, there is no doubt that
his desire to obtain a royal princess for his wife was
calculated to accentuate the distrust with which
he was regarded by the Protector and his friends.
He was well known to aspire to at least a share
in the government. As Elizabeth’s husband
his position would be so much strengthened that it
might be difficult to deny it to him, or to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the right of Somerset to retain supreme
power. His proceedings were therefore watched
with jealous vigilance, his designs upon the King’s
sister becoming quickly matter of public gossip.
It was not a day marked by an over-scrupulous
observance of respect for the dead, and Katherine
was hardly in her grave before the question of her
successor was freely canvassed amongst those chiefly
concerned in it.</p>

<p>“When I asked her [Ashley] what news she
had from London,” Elizabeth admitted when under
examination at a later date, “she answered merrily
‘They say that your Grace shall have my Lord
Admiral, and that he will shortly come to woo
you.’”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>The woman, an intriguer by nature and keen
to advance Seymour’s interests, would have further
persuaded her mistress to write a letter of condolence
to comfort him in his sorrow, “because,” as
Elizabeth explained, “he had been my friend in
the Queen’s lifetime and would think great kindness
therein. Then I said I would not, for he needs
it not.”</p>

<p>The blunt sincerity prompting the girl’s refusal
did her credit. It must have been patent to all
acquainted with the situation, and most of all to
Elizabeth, that the new-made widower stood in no
need of consolation. But, in spite of her refusal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
to open communications with him, and though
a visit proposed by Seymour was discouraged “for
fear of suspicion,” he can have felt little doubt that
in a struggle with Protector and Council he would
have the Princess on his side.</p>

<p>In Seymour’s household, naturally concerned in
his fortunes, the projected marriage was a subject of
anxious debate; and it was recognised by its members
that their master was playing a perilous game. In a
conversation between two of his dependants, Nicholas
Throckmorton and one Wightman, both shook their
heads over the risk he would run should he attempt
to carry his plan into effect.</p>

<p>Beginning with the conventional acknowledgment
of the Admiral’s great loss, they wisely decided that
it might after all turn to his advantage, in “making
him more humble in heart and stomach towards my
Lord Protector’s Grace.” It was also hoped that,
Katherine being dead, the Duchess of Somerset
might forget old grudges and, unless by his own
fault, be once again favourable towards her husband’s
brother. The two men nevertheless agreed that the
world was beginning to speak evil of Seymour, and,
discussing the chances of his attempt to match with
one of the Princesses, they determined, as they loved
him, to do their best to prevent it, Wightman in
especial engaging to do all he could to “break the
dance.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
If Seymour was going to his ruin it was not to be
for lack of warnings. Sleeping at the house of
Katherine’s friends, the Tyrwhitts, one night soon
after her death, the question of a marriage with
a sister of the King’s was mooted; when, although
Seymour’s aspirations were not definitely mentioned,
Sir Robert spoke in a fashion frankly discouraging
to any scheme of the kind on the part of his guest.</p>

<p>Conversing after supper with his hostess, Seymour
called to her husband as he passed by, saying jestingly
that he was talking with my lady his wife in
divinity&mdash;or divining of the future; that he had
told her he wished the crown of England might be
in as good a surety as that of France, where it was
well known who was heir. So would it be in
England were the Princesses married.</p>

<p>Tyrwhitt answered drily. Whosoever married
one of them without the consent of King or Council,
he said he would not wish to be in his place.</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked the Admiral. If he, for instance,
had married thus, would it not be surety for
the King? Was he not made by the King? Had he
not all he had by the King? Was he not most bound
to serve him truly?</p>

<p>Tyrwhitt refused to be convinced, reiterating that
the man who married either Princess had better be
stronger than the Council, for “if they catch hold of
him, they will shut him up.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Lord Russell, the Lord Privy Seal, spoke no
less openly to the adventurer of the danger he was
running. The two were riding together to Parliament
House in the Protector’s train, when Russell
opened the subject by observing that certain
rumours were abroad which he was very sorry to
hear, and that if the Admiral were seeking to marry
either of the King’s sisters&mdash;the special one being left
discreetly uncertain&mdash;“ye seek the means to undo
yourself and all those who shall come of you.”</p>

<p>Seymour replied carelessly that he had no such
thought, and the subject dropped. A few days later,
however, he himself re-introduced it, demanding
what reason existed to prevent him, or another man,
wedding one of the late King’s daughters? Again
Russell reiterated his warning. The marriage, he
declared, would prove fatal to him who made it,
proceeding to point out&mdash;knowing that the argument
would have more weight with the man with whom
he had to do than recommendations to caution and
prudence&mdash;that from a pecuniary point of view the
match would carry with it no great advantage, a
statement vehemently controverted by the Admiral,
who throughout neither felt nor feigned any indifference
to the financial aspect of the affair.</p>

<p>During the ensuing months he was busily engaged
in the prosecution of his scheme. He may have had
a genuine liking for the girl to whom his attentions
had already proved compromising; he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
scarcely doubt that he had won her affections.
But by a clandestine marriage Elizabeth would, under
the terms of her father’s will, have forfeited her right
to the succession, and she was therefore safeguarded
from any attempt on her suitor’s part to induce her
to dispense with the consent of the lawful authorities.
Forced to proceed with circumspection, he made use
of any opportunity that offered for maintaining a
hold upon her, aided and abetted by the partisanship
of her servants. A fortnight before Christmas he
proffered the loan of his London house as a lodging
when she should pay her winter visit to the
capital, adding to her cofferer, through whom the
suggestion was made, that he would come and see
her Grace; “which declaration,” reported to her by
Parry, “she seemed to take very gladly and to accept
it joyfully.” Observing, moreover, that when the conversation
turned upon Seymour, and especially when
he was commended, the Princess “showed such
countenance that it should appear she was very glad
to hear of him,” the cofferer was emboldened to
inquire whether, should the Council approve, she
would marry him.</p>

<p>“When that time comes to pass,” answered
Elizabeth, in the language of the day, “I will do as
God shall put in my mind.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her refusal to commit herself, it
was not difficult for those about her to divine after
what fashion she would, in that case, be moved to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
act. Yet she retained her independence of spirit,
and when told that the Admiral advised her to
appeal to the Protector through his wife for
certain grants of land, as well as for a London
residence, she turned upon those who had played
the part of his mouthpiece in a manner indicating no
intention of becoming his passive tool.</p>

<p>“I dare say he did not so,” she replied hotly,
refusing to credit the suggestion he was reported
to have made that she, a Tudor, should sue to his
brother’s wife in order to obtain her rights, “nor
would so.”</p>

<p>Parry adhered to his statement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “by my faith.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will not do so,” returned his mistress,
“and so tell him. I will not come there, nor begin
to flatter now.”</p>

<p>If the Admiral possessed partisans in the members
of Elizabeth’s household, it was probably no less
owing to hostility towards the Somersets than to
liking for himself; a passage of arms having taken
place between Mrs. Ashley and the Duchess, who had
found fault with the governess, on account of the
Princess having gone on a barge on the Thames by
night, “and for other light parts,” observing&mdash;in
which she was undoubtedly right&mdash;that Ashley was
not worthy to have the charge of the daughter of
a King. Such home-truths were not unfitted to
quicken the culprit’s zeal in the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Admiral, and Ashley was always at hand to push
his interests.</p>

<p>It was, nevertheless, necessary that the Princess’s
dependants should act with caution; and, discussing
with Lord Seymour the question of a visit he
desired to pay her, Parry declined to give any
opinion on the subject, professing himself unacquainted
with his mistress’s pleasure. The Admiral
answered with assumed indifference. It was no
matter, he said, “for there has been a talk of
late ... they say now I shall marry my Lady
Jane,” adding, “I tell you this but merrily, I tell
you this but merrily.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>The gossip may have been repeated in the certainty
that it would reach Elizabeth’s ears and in the
hope of rousing her to jealousy. But had it suited
his plans, there is no reason to doubt that Seymour
would not have hesitated to gain permanent possession
of the ward who had been left him “as a gage.”
Elizabeth was, however, nearer to the throne,
and was, beside her few additional years, better
suited to please his taste than the quiet child who
dwelt under his roof.</p>

<p>As it proved he was destined to further his
ambitious projects neither by marriage with Jane
nor her cousin. By the middle of January the
Protector had struck his blow&mdash;a blow which was
to end in fratricide. Charged with treason, in conspiring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to change the form of government and to
carry off the person of the King, Seymour was sent
on January 16 to the Tower&mdash;in those days so often
the ante-room to death.</p>

<p>Though he had long been suspected of harbouring
designs against his brother’s administration, the
specific grounds of his accusation were based upon
the confessions of one Sherrington, master of the
mint at Bristol; who, under examination, and in
terror for his personal safety, had declared, truly
or falsely, that he had promised to coin money for
the Admiral, and had heard him boast of the
number of his friends, saying that he thought more
gentlemen loved him than loved the Lord Protector.
The same witness added that he had heard Seymour
say that, for her qualities and virtues, Lady Jane
Grey was a fit match for the King, and he would
rather he should marry her than the daughter
of the Protector.</p>

<p>Many of great name and place in England must
have been disquieted by the news of the arrest of
the man who stood so near the King, and who, if
any one, could have counted upon being safeguarded
by position and rank from the consequences of his
rashness. His assertion that he was more loved
than his brother amongst his own class was true,
and not a few nobles will have trembled lest
they should be implicated in his fall. Loyalty to
a disgraced friend was not amongst the customs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
a day when the friendship might mean death,
and most men were anxious, on these occasions, to
dissociate themselves from a former comrade.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was not one of those with least to fear,
and it is the more honourable to her that she showed
no inclination to follow the example of others, or
to abandon the cause of her lover. She was in
an embarrassing, if not a dangerous situation.
No one knew to what extent she had been compromised,
morally or politically, and the distrust
of the Government was proved by the arrest of
both Ashley and Parry, and by the searching
examination to which the Princess, as well as her
servants, was subjected.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, placed in charge of the
delinquent, with directions to obtain from her all
the information he could, found it no easy task.</p>

<p>“I do assure your Grace,” he wrote to Somerset,
“she hath a good wit, and nothing is to be got
from her but by great policy.”</p>

<p>She would own to no “practice” with regard
to Seymour, either on her part or that of her
dependants. “And yet I do see in her face,” said
Sir Robert, “that she is guilty, and yet perceive
she will abide more storms before she will accuse
Mrs. Ashley.”</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of Elizabeth’s former
conduct, she displayed at this crisis no less staunchness
and fidelity in the support of those she loved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
than a capacity and ability rare in a girl of fifteen,
practically standing alone, confronted with enemies,
and without advisers to direct her course. Writing
to the Protector on January 28, she thanked him
for the gentleness and good will he had displayed;
professed her readiness to declare the truth in the
matter at issue; gave an account of her relations
with the Admiral, asserting her innocence of any
intention of marrying him without the sanction of
the Council; and vindicated her servants from blame.</p>

<p>“These be the things,” she concluded, “which
I declared to Master Tyrwhitt, and also whereof
my conscience beareth witness, which I would not
for all earthly things offend in anything, for I know
I have a soul to be saved as well as other folks
have; wherefore I will, above all things, have respect
unto the same.” One request she made, namely,
that she might come to Court. Rumours against
her honour were afloat, accusing her with being with
child by the Lord Admiral; and upon these grounds,
that she might show herself as she was, as well as
upon a desire to see the King, she based her
demand.</p>

<p>Tyrwhitt shook his head over the composition.
The singular harmony existing between Elizabeth’s
story and the depositions extracted from her
dependants in the Tower struck him as suspicious,
and as pointing to a preconcerted tale.</p>

<p>“They all sing one song,” he wrote, “and so, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
think, they would not, unless they had set the note
before”; and he continued to watch his charge
narrowly, and to report her demeanour at headquarters,
assisted in his office by his wife, who
had been sent to replace the untrustworthy Ashley
as governess to the Princess.</p>

<p>“She beginneth now a little to droop,” he wrote,
“by reason she heareth that my Lord Admiral’s
houses be dispersed. And my wife telleth me she
cannot hear him discommended, but she is ready to
make answer thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>Put as brave a face as she might upon the matter,
Elizabeth was in a position of singular loneliness
and difficulty. Her lover was in prison on a
capital charge, her friend and confidant removed
from her, her reputation tarnished. Nor was she
disposed to accept in a humble spirit the oversight
of the duenna sent her by the Council. As the
close friend of the step-mother whose kindness the
Princess had so ill requited, Lady Tyrwhitt, for
her part, would not in any case have been prejudiced
in favour of her charge, or inclined to take an
indulgent view of her misdemeanours; and the
reception accorded her when she arrived to assume
her thankless post was not such as to promote good
feeling. Mrs. Ashley, the girl told the new-comer,
was her mistress, and she had not so conducted
herself that the Council should give her another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Lady Tyrwhitt, no more inclined than she to
conciliation, retorted that, seeing the Princess had
allowed Mrs. Ashley to be her mistress, she need
not be ashamed to have any other honest woman
in that place, and so the intercourse of governess
and pupil was inaugurated.</p>

<p>That Lady Tyrwhitt’s taunt was undeniably
justified did not the more soften the Princess towards
her, and it was duly reported to the authorities in
London that she had taken “the matter so heavily
that she wept all that night and lowered all the
next day.... The love,” it was added, “she
yet beareth [Ashley] is to be wondered at.”</p>

<p>Tact and discretion might in time have availed
to reconcile the Princess to the change in her household;
but the methods employed by the Tyrwhitts
do not appear to have been judicious. Sir Robert,
taking up his wife’s quarrel, told her significantly
that if she considered her honour she would rather
ask to have a mistress than to be left without one;
and, complaining to his superiors that she could
not digest his advice in any way, added vindictively,
“If I should say my phantasy, it were more meet
she should have two than one.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>So the days went by, no doubt uncomfortably
enough for all concerned. Regarding Tyrwhitt and
his wife in the capacity of gaolers, charged with
the duty of eliciting her confessions, it was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
with them that Elizabeth would take counsel as
to the best course open to her. The revelations
attained by cross-examination from her imprisoned
servants as to the relations upon which she had
stood during the Queen’s lifetime with Katherine’s
husband, were sufficiently damaging to lend additional
colour to the scandalous reports in circulation, and
her spirited demand that her fair fame should be
vindicated by a proclamation forbidding the propagation
of slanders concerning the King’s sister
was fully in character with the woman she was to
become. Though not without delay, her request
was granted, and the circumstantial fable of a child
born and destroyed may be supposed to have been
effectually suppressed.</p>

<p>Whilst this had been Elizabeth’s condition during
the spring, the man to whom her troubles were
chiefly due had been undergoing alternations of
hope and fear. It may have seemed impossible
that his brother should proceed to extremities.
But there were times when, in the silence and
seclusion of the prison-house, his spirits grew
despondent. On February 16, when his confinement
had lasted a month, and his fate was still
undecided, his keeper, Christopher Eyre, reported
that on the previous Friday the Lord Admiral had
been very sad.</p>

<p>“I had thought,” he said, upon Eyre remarking
on his depression, “before I came to this place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
that my Lord’s Grace, with all the rest of the
Council, had been my friends, and that I had as
many friends as any man within this realm. But
now I think they have forgotten me,” proceeding
to declare that never was poor knave more true
to his Prince than he; nor had he meant evil to
his brother, though he had thought he might have
had the custody of the King.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>There is something pathetic in the dejection of
the Admiral, arrogant, proud, vain and ambitious,
thus deserted by all upon whose friendship he had
imagined himself able to count. It is impossible
to avoid the conviction that, in spite of a surface
boldness, the nobles of his day were apt to turn
craven where personal danger was in question. On the
battlefield valour was common enough, and when
once hope was over men had learnt&mdash;a needful
lesson&mdash;to meet death on the scaffold with
dignity and courage. But so long as a chance of
life remained, it was their constant habit to abase
themselves in order to escape their doom. We do
not hear of a single voice raised in Seymour’s
defence. The common people, when Somerset in
his turn had fallen a victim to jealousy and hate,
made no secret of their sorrow and their love; but
the nobles who had been his brother’s supporters
were silent and cowed, or went to swell the number
of his accusers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
By March 20 hope and fear were alike at an end.
A Bill of Attainder had been brought into the
House of Lords, after an examination of the culprit
before the Council, when his demand to be confronted
with his accusers had been refused. The
evidence against him was reiterated by certain of
the peers; the bill was passed without a division;
and, in spite of the opposition of the Commons, who
supported his claim to be heard in his own defence,
the Protector cut the matter short by a message
from the King declaring it unnecessary that the
demand should be conceded. His doom was sealed.</p>

<p>Was he innocent or guilty? Dr. Lingard, after
an examination of the facts, believes that he was
unjustly condemned; that, if he had sought a
portion of the power vested in the Protector, and
might have been dangerous to the authority of his
brother, the charge for which he was condemned&mdash;a
design to carry off the King and excite a civil
war&mdash;is unproved.</p>

<p>Innocent or guilty, he was to die. In the words
of Latimer&mdash;who, in sermons preached after the
execution, made himself the apologist of the Council
by abuse levelled at the dead man&mdash;he perished
“dangerously, irksomely, horribly.... Whether
he be saved or no, I leave it to God. But surely
he was a wicked man, and the realm is well rid
of him.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Thus Thomas Seymour was done to death by
a brother, and cursed by a churchman. Sherrington,
who had supplied the principal part of the evidence
against him, received a pardon and was reinstated
in his office.</p>

<p>Of regret upon the part of friends or kinsfolk
there is singularly little token. As they had fallen
from his side in life, so they held apart from him
in death. If Elizabeth mourned him she was
already too well versed in the world’s wisdom to
avow her grief, and is reported to have observed,
on his execution, that a man had died full of ability
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i>) but of scant judgment.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Whether or not
the Lord Protector was troubled by remorse, he was
not likely to make the public his confidant; and
Katherine, the woman who had loved him so devotedly,
was dead.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Protector’s conduct with regard to his
brother does much to alienate sympathy from
him in his approaching fall, in a sense the consequence
and outcome of the fratricide. He “had
sealed his doom the day on which he signed the
warrant for the execution of his brother.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> If
the Admiral, having crossed his will, was not safe,
who could believe himself to be so? Yet the fashion
of the accomplishing of his downfall, the treachery and
deception practised towards him by men upon whom
he might fairly have believed himself able to count,
lend a pathos to the end it might otherwise have
lacked.</p>

<p>For the present his power and position showed
no signs of diminution. The Queen, his wife’s
rival, was dead. The Admiral, who had dared to
measure his strength against his brother’s, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
trouble him no more, unless as an unquiet ghost,
an unwelcome visitant confronting him in unexpected
places. During his Protectorate he had
added property to property, field to field, and
was the master of two hundred manors. If
the public finances were low, Somerset was rich,
and during this year the building of the house
destined to bear his name was carried on on a
scale of splendour proportionate to his pretensions.
Having thrown away the chief prop of his house,
says Heylyn, he hoped to repair the ruin by erecting
a magnificent palace.</p>

<p>The site he had chosen was occupied by three
episcopal mansions and one parish church; but it
would have been a bold man who would have disputed
the will of the all-powerful Lord Protector,
and the owners submitted meekly to be dispossessed
in order to make room for his new abode. Materials
running short, there were rough-and-ready ways
of providing them conveniently near at hand; and
certain “superstitious buildings” close to St. Paul’s,
including one or two chapels and a “fair charnel-house”
were demolished to supply what was necessary,
the bones of the displaced dead being left to
find burial in the adjacent fields, or where they might.
As the great pile rose, more was required, and
St. Margaret’s, Westminster, was to have been
destroyed to furnish it, had not the people, less
subservient than the Bishops, risen to protect their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
church, and forcibly driven away the labourers
charged with the work of destruction. St. Margaret’s
was saved, but St. John’s of Jerusalem, not
far from Smithfield, was sacrificed in its stead, being
blown up with gunpowder in order that its stone-work
might be turned to account.</p>

<p>The Protector pursued his way unconscious of
danger. The Earl of Warwick, his future supplanter,
looked on and bided his time. The condition of
the country had become such as to facilitate the
designs of those bent upon a change in the Government.
Into the course of public affairs, at home
and abroad, it is impossible to enter at length; a
brief summary will suffice to show that events
were tending to create discontent and to strengthen
the hands of Somerset’s enemies.</p>

<p>The victory of Pinkie Cleugh, though gratifying
to national pride, had in nowise served the purpose
of terminating the war with Scotland. Renewed
with varying success, the Scots, by means of French
aid, had upon the whole improved their position,
and the hopes indulged in England of a union
between the two countries, to be peacefully effected
by the marriage of the King with the infant Mary
Stuart, had been disappointed, the little Queen
having been sent to France and affianced to the
Dauphin. In the distress prevailing amongst
the working classes of England, more pressing
cause for dissatisfaction and agitation was found.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Partly the result of the depreciation of the currency
during the late reign, it was also due to the action
of the new owners who, enriched by ecclesiastical
property, had enclosed portions of Church lands
heretofore left open to be utilised by the labourers
for their personal profit. Pasturage was increasing
in favour compared with tillage; less labour was
required, and wages had in consequence fallen.</p>

<p>To material ills and privations, other grievances
were added. Associated in the minds of the people
with their condition of want were the changes lately
enforced in the sphere of religion. The new ministers
were often ignorant men, who gave scandal by
their manner of life, their parishioners frequently
making complaints of them to the Bishops.</p>

<p>“Our curate is naught,” they would say, “an
ass-head, a dodipot [?], a lack-latin, and can do
nothing. Shall I pay him tithe that doth us no
good, nor none will do?”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>In some cases the fault lay with patrons, who
preferred to select a man unlikely to assert his
authority. Economy on the part of the Government
was responsible for other unfit appointments,
and capable Churchmen being permitted to hold
secular offices, they were removed from their parishes
and their flocks were left unshepherded. Against
this practice Latimer protested in a sermon at St.
Paul’s, on the occasion of a clergyman having been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
made Comptroller of the Mint. Who controlled
the devil at home in his parish, asked the rough-tongued
preacher, whilst he controlled the Mint?</p>

<p>The condition of things thus produced was not
calculated to commend the innovations it accompanied
to the people, and the introduction of the
new Prayer-book was in particular bitterly resented
in country districts. In many parts of England,
interest and religion joining hands, fierce insurrections
broke out, and the measures taken by “the
good Duke” to allay popular irritation, by ordering
that the lands newly enclosed should be re-opened,
had the double effect of stirring the people, thus
far successful, to yet more strenuous action in
vindication of their rights, and of increasing the dislike
and distrust with which his irresponsible exercise
of authority was regarded by the upper classes.</p>

<p>Upon domestic troubles&mdash;Ket’s rebellion in Norfolk,
one of large dimensions in the west, and
others&mdash;followed a declaration of war with France,
certain successes on the part of the enemy serving
to discredit the Protector and his management of
affairs still further.</p>

<p>Whilst rich and poor were alike disaffected in
the country at large, the Duke had become an
object of jealousy to the members of the Council
Board who were responsible for having placed
him in the position he occupied. To a man with
the sagacity to look ahead and take account of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
forces at work, it must have been plain that the
possession of absolute and undivided power on the
part of a subject was necessarily fraught with danger,
and that the Duke’s astonishing success in obtaining
the patent conferring upon him supreme
and regal authority contained in itself the seed and
prophecy of ruin. But, besides more serious causes
of offence, his bearing in the Council-chamber, far
from being adapted to conciliate opposition, further
exasperated his colleagues against him. Cranmer
and Paget were the last to abandon his cause, but
on May 8&mdash;not two months after his brother’s
execution&mdash;the latter wrote to give him frank
warning of the probable consequences of his “great
cholerick fashions.” It is evident that a stormy
scene had taken place that afternoon, and that Paget
must have been strongly convinced of the need
for interference before he addressed his remonstrance
to the despotic head of the Government.</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Richard a Lee,” he wrote, “this afternoon,
after your Grace had very sore, and much
more than needed, rebuked him, came to my chamber
weeping, and there complaining, as far as became
him, of your handling of him, seemed almost out of
wits and out of heart. Your Grace had put him
clean out of countenance.” After which he proceeded
to warn the Duke solemnly, “for the very love he
bore him,” of the consequences should he not change
his manner of conduct.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Paget’s love was quickly to grow cold. During
the summer the various rebellions in different parts
of the country were suppressed, the Earl of Warwick
playing an important part in the operations. On September
25 the Protector was, to all appearance, still
in fulness of power and authority. By October 13
he was in the Tower.</p>

<p>The Spanish spectator again supplies an account
of the view taken by the man in the street of
the initiation of the quarrel which led to the
Duke’s disgrace and fall. Returned to London,
Warwick, accompanied by the captains, English
and foreign, who had served under him against
the rebels, is said to have come to Court to
demand for his soldiers the rewards he considered
their due. Met by a refusal on the part of the
Protector of anything over and above their ordinary
wages, his indignation found vent. If money was
not to be had, it was because of the sums squandered
by the Duke in building his own palace. The French
forts were already lost. If the Protector continued
in power he would end by losing everything.</p>

<p>Somerset replied with no less heat. He deserved,
he said, that Warwick should speak as he had spoken,
by the favour he had shown him. Warwick
having retorted that it was with himself and his
colleagues that the fault lay, since they had bestowed
so much power on the Protector, the two parted.
Of what followed Holinshed gives a description.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
“Suddenly, upon what occasion many marvelled
but few knew, every lord and councillor went
through the city weaponed, and had their servants
likewise weaponed ... to the great wondering of
many; and at the last a great assembly of the said
Council was made at the Earl of Warwick’s lodging,
which was then at Ely Place, in Holborn, whither all
the confederates came privily armed, and finally
concluded to possess the Tower of London.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>As a counterblast, Somerset issued a proclamation
in the King’s name, summoning all his subjects to
Hampton Court for his defence and that of his “most
entirely beloved uncle.” Open war was declared.</p>

<p>So far the Archbishop and Paget, both resident
with the Court, together with the two Secretaries,
had adhered to the Protector. Upon Cranmer, if
upon any one, Somerset, who had done more than
any other person to establish religion upon its new
basis, should have been able to count, if not for
support, for a loyal opposition. But fear is strong
and&mdash;again it must be repeated&mdash;fidelity to the
unfortunate was no feature of the times; and by
both Archbishop and Paget the cause of the falling
man was abandoned. Not only did they secretly
embrace the cause of the party headed by Warwick,
but private directions were furnished by Paget as to
the means to be employed in seizing the person of
the Duke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Meantime, Hampton Court being judged insufficiently
secure, Somerset, with a guard of five hundred
men, had removed the King, at dead of night, to
Windsor, a graphic account of the journey being
given by the chronicler.</p>

<p>“As he went along the road the King was all
armed, and carried his little sword drawn, and kept
saying to the people on the way:</p>

<p>“‘My vassals, will you help me against the people
who want to kill me?’</p>

<p>“And everybody cried out, ‘Sir, we will all die for
you.’”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>Windsor reached, the defence of the Castle and
of the sovereign was wisely entrusted, in the first
instance, to men upon whom the Duke could depend.
But the Council was successful in lulling any
apprehensions of violent action to rest. Sir Philip
Hoby, according to some authorities,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> was despatched
from London with open, as well as secret, letters,
wherein it was declared that no harm was intended
to the Duke; order was merely to be taken for
the Protectorship. Somerset had by this time
yielded so far to the forces arrayed against him as
to recognise the necessity of consenting to some
change in the government; and at the reassuring
terms of the communication all present gave way to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
emotion; wept with joy, after the fashion of the
times; thanked God, and prayed for the Lords;
Paget, in particular, clasping the Duke about the
knees, and crying with tears, “O my Lord, ye see
what my lords be!”</p>

<p>The Protector’s ruin had been assured. Trusting
to the declarations of the Council, he fell
an easy prey into their hands. Yielding to the
representations of Cranmer and Paget, to whose
“diligent travail” his enemies gratefully ascribed
their success, he permitted his trusty followers to be
replaced in the defence of the Castle by the usual
royal guard; on October 11 he had been seized and
placed in safe keeping, and it was reported that the
King had a bad cold, and “much desireth to be hence,
saying that ‘Methinks I am in prison. Here be no
galleries nor no gardens to walk in.’”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> The young
sovereign had also, with a merry countenance and a
loud voice, asked how their Lordships of the Council
were, and when he would see them, saying that they
should be welcome whensoever they came.</p>

<p>It was plain that objections to a transference of
his guardianship were not to be expected from the
nephew of the Lord Protector, and the Duke was
removed from Windsor to the Tower, followed by
three hundred lords and gentlemen, “as if he had
been a captive carried in triumph.” It would,
however, have been more difficult to induce the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
boy to consent to the execution of another of his
closest kin, and there may have been some fraction
of truth in the report which gained currency that
the King had not been made acquainted with the
fact that his uncle was actually a prisoner until
he learnt it from the Duchess. He then sent for
the Archbishop and questioned him on the subject.</p>

<p>“Godfather,” he is made to say, “what has
become of my uncle, the Duke?” The explanation
furnished him by Cranmer&mdash;to the effect that,
had God not helped the Lords, the country would
have been ruined, and it was feared that the Protector
might have slain the King himself&mdash;did not
appear to commend itself to the young sovereign.
The Duke, he said, had never done him any harm,
and he did not wish him to be killed.</p>

<p>A King’s wishes, even at thirteen, have weight,
and Warwick suddenly discovered that good should
be returned for evil; and that since it was the King’s
desire, and the first thing he had asked of his
Council, the Duke must be pardoned.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>What is more certain is that, on condition of
an unqualified acknowledgment of his guilt, accompanied
by forfeiture of offices and property, it
was decided that Somerset should be set at liberty.
Self-respect or dignity was not in fashion, and in
the eyes of some the submission of the late Lord
Protector assumed the character of an “abjectness.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
For the moment it purchased for him safety, and
he was gradually permitted to regain a certain
amount of influence and power. Some portion of
his wealth was restored to him, and he was at length
readmitted to the Council and to a limited share
in the government. To sanguine eyes all seemed
to have been placed on a satisfactory footing; but
jealousy, distrust, and hatred take much killing.
The position of the man who was the King’s
nearest of kin amongst his nobles, and had lately
been all-powerful in the State, was a difficult one.
Warwick was rising, and meant to rise; Somerset
was not content to remain fallen and discredited.
What seemed a peace was merely an armistice.</p>

<p>Meantime Warwick and his friends were no
more successful than his rival in maintaining the
national honour, and the peace with France concluded
during the spring was regarded by the nation as
a disgrace. Boulogne was surrendered to its natural
owners, and in magniloquent terms war was once
more stated to be at an end for ever between the
two countries.</p>

<p>Court and courtiers troubled themselves little
with such matters, and on St. George’s Day a
brilliant company of Lords of the Council and
Knights of the Garter kept the festival at Greenwich;
when a glimpse of the thirteen-year-old King is
to be caught, in a more boyish mood than usual.</p>

<p>Coming out from the discourse preached in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
honour of the day, in high spirits and in the
argumentative humour fostered by sermons, the
“godly and virtuous imp” turned to his train.</p>

<p>“My Lords,” he demanded, “I pray you, what
saint is St. George, that we here so honour him?”</p>

<p>The sudden attack was unexpected, and, the Lords
of the Council being “astonied” by it, it was the
Treasurer who made reply.</p>

<p>“If it please Your Majesty,” he said, “I did
never read in any history of St. George, but only
in <cite>Legenda Aurea</cite>, where it is thus set down, that
St. George out with his sword and ran the dragon
through with his spear.”</p>

<p>The King, when he could not a great while
speak for laughing, at length said:</p>

<p>“I pray you, my Lord, and what did he do with
his sword the while?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell Your Majesty,” said he.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Poor little King! poor “godly imp”! It is seldom
that his laughter rings out through the centuries.
Perhaps some of the grave Councillors or divines
present may have looked askance, considering that
it was not with the weapon of ridicule that the
patron saint of England should be most fitly attacked,
but with the more legitimate one of theological
criticism. But to us it is satisfactory to find
that there were times when even the modern Josiah
could not speak for laughing.</p>

<span class="subhead">Lady Jane Grey at home&mdash;Visit from Roger Ascham&mdash;The German
divines&mdash;Position of Lady Jane in the theological world.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Whilst</span> these events had been taking place
Jane Grey had been once more relegated
to the care of her parents, to whose house she had
been removed upon the imprisonment of her guardian,
the Admiral, in January, 1549. To the helpless and
passive plaything of worldly and political exigencies,
the change from Seymour Place and Hanworth,
where she had lived under Seymour’s roof, to the
quiet of her father’s Leicestershire home, must have
been great.</p>

<p>Nor was the difference in the moral atmosphere
less marked. Handsome, unprincipled, gay, magnificent,
one imagines that the Admiral, in spite of
the faults to which she was probably not blind, must
have been an imposing personage in the eyes of
his little charge; and self-interest&mdash;the interest
of a man who did not guess that the future held
nothing for him but a grave&mdash;as well as natural
kindliness towards a child dependent upon him,
will have led him to play the part of her “half-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>father”
in a manner to win her affection. Was she
not destined, should his schemes prosper, to fill the
place of Queen Consort? or, failing that, might it
not be well to turn into earnest the “merry” possibility
he had mentioned to Parry, and, if Elizabeth
was denied him, to make her cousin his wife? In
any case, so long as she lived in his house, Jane
was a guest of importance, of royal blood, to be
treated with consideration, cared for, and flattered.</p>

<p>But now the ill-assorted house-mates had parted.
Seymour had taken his way to the Tower, as a stage
towards the scaffold; and Jane had returned&mdash;gladly
or sorrowfully, who can tell?&mdash;to the shelter of the
parental roof, and to the care of a father and mother
determined upon neutralising by their conduct any
ill-effects produced by her two years of emancipation
from their control. Once more she was an insignificant
member of her father’s family, the eldest of
his three children, subjected to the strictest discipline
and, whatever the future might bring forth,
of little consequence in the present.</p>

<p>It is possible that Lord Dorset’s fears, expressed
at the time when he was attempting to regain possession
of his daughter, had been in part realised;
and that Jane, “for lack of a bridle,” had “taken
too much the head,” and conceived an unduly
high opinion of herself&mdash;it would indeed have been
a natural outcome of the position she held both
in her guardian’s house and, as will be seen, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the estimation of divines. If this was the case, her
mother and he were to do their best to “address
her mind to humility, soberness, and obedience.”
The means taken to carry out their intentions
were harsh.</p>

<p>Of the year following upon Jane’s return to
Bradgate little is known; but in the summer of
1550, a picturesque and vivid sketch is afforded
by Roger Ascham of the child of thirteen<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> upon
whom so many hopes centred and so many expectations
were built. In the description given in his
<cite>Schoolmaster</cite><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> of the visit paid by the great scholar
to Bradgate, light is thrown alike upon the system
of training pursued by Lord Dorset, upon the
character of his daughter, and upon the spirit she
displayed in conforming to the manner of life enforced
upon her.</p>

<p>Ascham, in his capacity of tutor to her cousin
Elizabeth, had known Jane intimately at Court&mdash;so
he states in a letter to Sturm, another of the academic
brotherhood&mdash;and had already received learned
letters from her. Before starting on a diplomatic
mission to Germany in the summer of 1550, he had
visited some friends in Yorkshire, and on his way
south turned aside to renew his acquaintance with
Lady Jane, and to pay his respects to her father,
who stood high in the estimation of the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
party to which Ascham belonged. To this visit we
owe one of the most distinct glimpses of the girl
that we possess.</p>

<p>By a fortunate chance he found “that most noble
Lady Jane Grey, to whom I was exceeding much
beholden,” alone. Lord and Lady Dorset, with all
their household, were hunting in the park, and Jane,
in the seclusion of her chamber, was engaged in
studying the <cite>Phaedo</cite> of Plato, “with as much delight
as some gentlemen would read a merry tale in
Boccaccio,” when Ascham presented himself to her.</p>

<p>The conversation between the scholar and the
student places Lady Jane’s small staid figure in
clear relief. Notwithstanding Plato’s <cite>Phaedo</cite>, notwithstanding,
too, the sun outside, the sounds of
horns, the baying of hounds, and all the other
allurements she had proved able to resist, there is
something very human and unsaintly in her fashion
of unburthening herself to a congenial spirit concerning
the wrongs sustained at the parental hands.
To Ascham, with whom she had been so well
acquainted under different circumstances, she opened
her mind freely when, “after salutation and duty
done,” he inquired how it befell that she had left
the pastimes going forward in the Park.</p>

<div id="ip_142" class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
  <img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="461" height="600" alt="" />
  <p class="p0 in0 smaller">After an engraving.</p>
  <div class="caption"><p>LADY JANE GREY.</p></div></div>

<p>“I wis,” she answered smiling&mdash;the smile, surely,
of conscious and complacent superiority&mdash;“all their
sport in the Park is but a shadow to the pleasure
that I find in Plato. Alas, good folk, they never
felt what true pleasure meant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
“And how came you, Madame,” asked Ascham,
“to this deep knowledge of pleasure, and what did
chiefly allure you to it, seeing not many women,
but very few men, have attained thereto?”</p>

<p>Jane, nothing loath to satisfy her guest’s curiosity,
did so at length.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” she answered, “and tell you a
truth, which perchance you will marvel at. One
of the greatest benefits that ever God gave me is
that He sent me so sharp and severe parents and
so gentle a schoolmaster. For when I am in
presence either of father or mother, whether I speak,
keep silence, sit, stand, or go, eat, drink, be merry
or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything
else, I must do it, as it were, in such weight,
measure, and number, even so perfectly as God
made the world, or else I am so sharply taunted,
so cruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with
pinches, nips, and bobs, and other ways, which I
will not name for the honour I bear them, so without
measure disordered, that I think myself in hell,
till time come that I must go to Mr. Elmer, who
teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly, with such fair
allurements to learning, that I think all the time
nothing whiles I am with him. And when I am
called away from him I fall on weeping, because,
whatever I do else but learning is full of grief,
trouble, fear, and whole misliking unto me. And
thus my book hath been so much my pleasure, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
bringeth daily to me more pleasure and more, that
in respect of it all other pleasures in very deed be
but trifles and troubles to me.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>Jane’s recital of her wrongs, if correctly reported&mdash;and
Ascham says he remembers the conversation
gladly, both because it was so worthy of memory,
and because it was the last time he ever saw that
noble and worthy lady&mdash;proves that her command
of the vernacular was equal to her proficiency in
the dead languages, and that she cherished a very
natural resentment for the treatment to which she
was subjected. There is something irresistibly provocative
of laughter in the thought of the two
scholars, old and young, and of the lofty compassion
displayed by the chidden child towards the frivolous
tastes and amusements of the parents to whom she
doubtless outwardly accorded the exaggerated respect
and reverence demanded by custom. Few would
grudge the satisfaction derived from a sympathetic
listener to the girl whose pleasures were to be so
few and days for enjoying them so short.</p>

<p>When Ascham took leave he had received a
promise from Jane to write to him in Greek, provided
that he would challenge her by a letter from
Germany. And so they parted, to meet no more.</p>

<p>It may be that Lady Jane’s sense of the harshness
and severity of her treatment at home was accentuated
by the tone adopted with regard to her by many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of the leading Protestant divines. To these men&mdash;men
to whom Mary was Jezebel, Gardiner that
lying and subtle Cerberus,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> and by whom persons
holding theological views at variance with their own
were freely and unreservedly handed over to the
devil&mdash;Jane was not only wise, learned, and saintly
beyond her years, but to her they turned their eyes,
hoping for a future when, at the King’s side, she
might prove the efficient protectress and patroness
of the reformed Church. Her name was a household
word amongst them, and whilst it can have been
scarcely possible that she was indifferent to the
incense offered by those to whom she had been
instructed to look up, it may have rendered the
system of repression adopted by her parents more
unendurable than might otherwise have been the case.</p>

<p>Bradgate was a centre of strong and militant
Protestantism. In conjunction with Warwick, the
Marquis of Dorset was regarded by the German
school of theologians as one of the “two most
shining lights of the Church;”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> and the many letters
sent from England to Henry Bullinger at Zurich&mdash;some
of them dated from Bradgate itself&mdash;abound
in allusions to the family, and throw a useful
light upon this part of Lady Jane’s life. In these
epistles her father’s name recurs again and again,
always in terms of extravagant eulogy, and as that
of a munificent patron of needy divines. Thus he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
had bestowed a pension at first sight upon Ulmis,
a young disciple of Bullinger’s, doubling it some
months later; and his grateful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégé</i>, striving to
make what return is possible, impresses upon the
foreign master the advisability of dedicating one of
his works to the generous Marquis, anxiously
sending him, when his request has been granted,
the full title to be used in so doing. “He told me,
indeed,” he adds, “that he had the title of Prince,
but that he would not wish to be so styled by you,
so you must judge for yourself whether to keep
it back or not.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Bullinger is likewise urged to
present a copy of one of his books to the Marquis’s
daughter, “and, take my word for it, you will never
repent having done so.” A most learned and
courteous letter would thereby be elicited from her.
She had already translated into Greek a good part
of Bullinger’s treatise on marriage, put by Ulmis
himself into Latin, and had given it to her father
as a New Year’s gift.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> In May, 1551, another letter
records that two days had been very agreeably
passed at Bradgate with Jane, my Lord’s daughter,
and those excellent and holy persons Aylmer, her
tutor, and Haddon, chaplain to the Marquis. “For
my own part, I do not think there ever lived any
one more deserving of respect than this young
lady, if you regard her family; more learned, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
you consider her age; or more happy, if you
consider both. A report has prevailed, and has
begun to be talked of by persons of consequence,
that this most noble virgin is to be betrothed and
given in marriage to the King’s majesty. Oh, if
that event should take place, how happy would be
the union, and how beneficial to the church!”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>A letter despatched by Ulmis on the same day to
another of his brethren in the faith, Conrad Pellican,
craves his advice on behalf of Lady Jane with regard
to the best means of acquiring Hebrew, a language
she was anxious to study. She had written to
consult Bullinger on the subject, but Bullinger was
a busy man, and all the world knew how perfect
was Pellican’s acquaintance with the subject.
Pellican may argue that he might seem lacking
in modesty should he address a young lady, the
daughter of a nobleman, unknown to him personally.
But he is besought by Ulmis to entertain no
fears of the kind, and his correspondent will bear all
the blame if he ever repents of the deed, or if
Lady Jane does not most willingly acknowledge his
courtesy. “In truth,” he adds, “I do not think
that amongst the English nobility for many ages
past there has arisen a single individual who, to
the highest excellences of talent and judgment, has
united so much diligence and assiduity in the
cultivation of every liberal pursuit.... It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
incredible how far she has advanced already, and
to what perfection she will advance in a few years;
for I well know that she will complete what she
has begun, unless perhaps she be diverted from
her pursuits by some calamity of the times....
If you write a letter to her, take care, I pray you,
that it be first delivered to me.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>The letter is dated from the house of the daughter
of the Marquis. Her mother, it is true, seems
to have been at home, though Dorset was in
Scotland; but it is a curious fact that the grand-daughter
of Henry VII., through whom Jane’s royal
blood was transmitted to her, appears to have been
by common consent tacitly passed over, as a person
of no consequence in comparison with her daughter.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>Quite a budget of letters were entrusted to the
courier who left Bradgate on May 29, and was the
bearer of the missives addressed by Ulmis to his
master and his friend. Both John Aylmer, tutor
to Lord Dorset’s children and afterwards Bishop of
London, and Haddon, the Marquis’s chaplain, had
taken the opportunity of writing to Bullinger, doubtless
stimulated to the effort by his young disciple.</p>

<p>The preceptor who compared so favourably in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Lady Jane’s eyes with her parents, was a young
Norfolk man, of about twenty-nine, and singularly
well learned in the Latin and Greek tongues.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> On
James Haddon, Bishop Hooper, writing from prison
when, three years later, the friends of the Reformation
had fallen on evil days, pronounced a eulogy in
a letter to Bullinger. Master James Haddon, he
said, was not only a friend and very dear brother in
Christ, but one he had always esteemed on account of
his singular erudition and virtue. “I do not think,”
he added, “that I have ever been acquainted with
any one in England who is endued either with more
sincere piety towards God or more removed from
all desire of those perishing objects desired by foolish
mortals.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> From Bishop Hooper the panegyric is
evidence that Haddon belonged to the extreme party
in theological matters, in which Aylmer was probably
in full accord with him. On this particular day
in May both these devoted and conscientious men
were sending letters to the great director of souls in
Zurich, that of Haddon being written to a man
to whom he was personally unknown, and with the
sole object of opening a correspondence and offering
a tribute of respect.</p>

<p>Aylmer’s case was a different one. Though also
a stranger, he wrote at some length, chiefly in the
character of the preceptor entrusted with Lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Jane’s education, making due acknowledgments
for the letters and advice which had been of so
much use in keeping his patron and his patron’s
family in the right path, and begging Bullinger to
continue these good offices towards the pupil,
just fourteen, concerning whom it is strange to find
the young man entertaining certain fears and misgivings.</p>

<p>“At that age,” he observes, “as the comic poet
tells us, all people are inclined to follow their own
ways, and, by the attractiveness of the objects and
the corruptions of nature, are more easily carried
headlong in pleasure ... than induced to follow
those studies that are attended with the praise of
virtue.” The time teemed with many disorders;
discreet physicians must therefore be sought, and
to tender minds there should not be wanting the
counsel of the aged nor the authority of grave and
influential men. Aylmer accordingly entreats that
Bullinger will minister, by letter and advice, to the
improvement of his charge.</p>

<p>An epistle from Jane, dated July 1551, shows
that the German theologian responded at once to
the appeal, since in it she acknowledges the receipt
of a most eloquent and weighty letter, and mentioning
the loss she had sustained in the death of
Bucer, who appears to have taken his part in her
theological training, congratulates herself upon the
possession of a friend so learned as Bullinger, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
pious a divine, and so intrepid a champion of true
religion. Bereaved of the “pious Bucer ... who
unweariedly did not cease, day and night, and to the
utmost of his ability, to supply me with all necessary
instructions and directions for my conduct in life,
and who by his excellent advice promoted and encouraged
my progress and advancement in all virtue,
godliness, and learning,” she proceeds to beg
Bullinger to fill the vacant place, and to spur her on
if she should loiter and be disposed to delay. By
this means she will enjoy the same advantages
granted to those women to whom St. Jerome imparted
instruction, or to the elect lady to whom the
epistle of St. John was addressed, or to the mother
of Severus, taught by Origen. As Bullinger could
be deemed inferior to none of these teachers, she
entreats him to manifest a like kindness.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> It is
plain that Lady Jane, in addressing this “brightest
ornament and support of the whole Church,” is
determined not to be outdone in the art of pious
flattery; and in her correspondence with men who
both as scholars and divines held a foremost place
in the estimation of those by whom she was surrounded,
she indemnified herself for the mortifications
inflicted upon her at home.</p>

and to strengthen and maintain their influence over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
one who might have a prominent part to play
in future years was of the first importance. A letter
from Ascham, who was still abroad, dated some
months later, supplies yet another example of the
incense offered to the child of fourteen, and of
fulsome adulation by which an older head might
have been turned. Nothing, he told her, in
his travels, had raised in him greater admiration
than had been caused when, on his visit to
Bradgate, he had found one so young and lovely&mdash;so
divine a maid&mdash;engaged in the study of Plato whilst
friends and relations were enjoying field sports. Let
her proceed thus, to the honour of her country, the
delight of her parents, her own glory, the praise of
her preceptor, the comfort of her relations and
acquaintances, and the admiration of all. O happy
Aylmer, to have a like scholar!</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply quotations which
indicate the place accorded to Lord Dorset’s
daughter in the estimation of the leaders of the
extreme party of Protestantism, in whose eyes
Cranmer was regarded as a possible trimmer.
Allowing to him “right views,” Hooper, in writing
to Bullinger, adds: “we desire nothing more for
him than a firm and manly spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> “Contrary to
general expectation,” Traheron writes, the Archbishop
had most openly, firmly, and learnedly maintained
the opinion of the German divine upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Eucharist; and Ulmis, alluding to him in terms of
praise, repeats that he had unexpectedly given a
correct judgment on this point. Even the youngest
of the German theologians felt himself competent
to weigh in the balances the head of Protestant
England.</p>

<p>Protestant England was itself keeping a wary eye
upon its Primate. “The Archbishop of Canterbury,”
wrote Hooper to Bullinger, “to tell the truth,
neither took much note of your letter nor of your
learned present. But now, as I hope, Master
Bullinger and Canterbury entertain the same
opinion.” “The people ... that many-headed
monster,” he wrote again, “is still wincing, partly
through ignorance, and partly persuaded by the inveiglements
of the Bishops and the malice and
impiety of the mass-priests.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

guilt or innocence&mdash;His trial and condemnation&mdash;The King’s
indifference&mdash;Christmas at Greenwich&mdash;The Duke’s execution.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Aylmer</span> had been so far encouraged by the
success of his appeal to Henry Bullinger
on behalf of his pupil that he is found, some seven
months later, calling the Swiss churchman again into
council. He was possibly over-anxious, but the tone
of his communication makes it clear that Lady Jane
Grey had been once more causing her tutor disquiet.
Responding, in the first place, to Bullinger’s congratulations
upon his privilege in acting as teacher
to so excellent a scholar, and in a family so well
disposed to learning and religion, he proceeds to
request that his correspondent will, in his next
letter, instruct Lady Jane as to the proper degree
of embellishment and adornment of the person
becoming in young women professing godliness.
The tutor is plainly uneasy on this subject, and it is
to be feared that Jane had been developing an undue
love of dress. Yet the example of the Princess
Elizabeth might be fitly adduced, observes Aylmer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
furnishing the monitor with arguments of which he
might, if he pleased, make use. She at least went
clad in every respect as became a young maiden, and
yet no one was induced by the example of “a lady
in so much gospel light to lay aside, much less look
down upon, gold, jewels, and braidings of the hair.”
Preachers might declaim, but no one amended her
life. Moreover, and as a less important matter,
Aylmer desires Bullinger to prescribe the amount of
time to be devoted to music. If he would handle
these points at some length there would probably be
some accession to the ranks of virtue.</p>

<p>One would imagine that it argued ignorance of
human nature on the part of Lady Jane’s instructor
to believe that the admonitions of an old man at
a distance would have more effect than those of a
young man close at hand; nor does it appear
whether or not Bullinger sent the advice for which
Aylmer asked. But that his pupil’s incipient leaning
towards worldly vanities was successfully checked
would appear from her reply, reported by himself,
when a costly dress had been presented to her by her
cousin Mary. “It were a shame,” she is said to have
answered, in rejecting the gift, “to follow my Lady
Mary, who leaveth God’s Word, and leave my Lady
Elizabeth, who followeth God’s Word.”</p>

<p>It might have been well for Jane had she practised
greater courtesy towards a cousin at this time out of
favour at Court; but no considerations of policy or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of good breeding could be expected to influence a
zealot of fifteen, and Mary, more than double her
age, may well have listened with a smile.</p>

<p>When Aylmer’s letter was written, the Grey
family had left Bradgate and were in London. The
Marquis had, some two months earlier, been advanced
to the rank of Duke of Suffolk, upon the
title becoming extinct through the death of his
wife’s two half-brothers, and the tutor may have
had just cause for disquietude lest the world should
make good its claims upon the little soul he was
so carefully tending. In November 1551 Mary
of Lorraine, Queen-Dowager of Scotland, had
applied for leave to pass through England on her
way north. It had not only been granted, but she
had been accorded a magnificent reception, Lady
Jane, with her mother, taking part in the ceremony
when the royal guest visited the King at
Whitehall. Two days later she was amongst
the ladies assembled to do the Queen honour at
her departure for Scotland. It may be that this
participation in the pomp and splendour of court
life had produced a tendency in John Aylmer’s
charge to bestow overmuch attention upon worldly
matters, nor can it be doubted that his heart was
sore at the contrast she had presented to Elizabeth,
“whose plainness of dress,” he says, still commending
the Princess, “was especially noticed on the occasion
of the visit of the Queen-Dowager of Scotland.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Perhaps, too, the master looked back with regret to
the quiet days of uninterrupted study. The Dorset
household, when not in London itself, were now to
be chiefly resident at Sheen, within reach of the
Court. Jane, too, was growing up; Aylmer was
young; and to the “gentle schoolmaster” the
training of Lord Dorset’s eldest daughter may have
had an interest not wholly confined to scholarship
or to theology. It is nevertheless impossible to put
back the clock, and the days when his pupil could
be expected to devote herself exclusively to her
studies were irrevocably past.</p>

<p>Meantime the hollow treaty of amity between the
two great competitors for supremacy in the realm
was to end. In the spring of 1551 Somerset and
Warwick were on terms of outward cordiality, and
a marriage between the Duke’s daughter and the
eldest son of his rival, which took place with much
magnificence in the presence of the King, might have
been expected to cement their friendship. But
by October “carry-tales and flatterers,” says one
chronicler, had rendered harmony&mdash;even the semblance
of harmony&mdash;impossible; or, as was more
probable, Warwick, suspicious of the intention on the
part of the Duke of regaining the direction of
affairs, had determined to free himself once for all
from the rivalry of the King’s uncle. Somerset had
again been lodged in the Tower, to leave it, this
time, only for the scaffold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
On the question of his innocence or guilt there has
been much discussion amongst historians, nor is it
possible to enter at length into the question.
The crimes of which he stood accused were of the
blackest dye. “The good Duke,” as the people still
loved to call him, was charged with plotting to gain
possession of the King’s person, of contriving the
murder of Warwick, now to be created Duke of
Northumberland, of Northampton and Herbert, and
was to be tried for treason and felony.</p>

<p>Many and various are the views taken as to the
guilt of the late Protector. Mr. Tytler, most conscientious
of historians, after a careful comparison of
contemporary evidence, has decided in his favour.
Others have come to a different conclusion. The
balance of opinion appears to be on his side. His
bearing throughout the previous summer had been
that of an innocent man, who had nothing to fear
from justice. But justice was hard to come by.
His enemy was strong and relentless&mdash;“a competent
lawyer, known soldier, able statesman”&mdash;and in
each of these capacities he was seeking to bring a
dangerous competitor to ruin. It was, says Fuller,
almost like a struggle between a naked and an armed
man.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Yet, open-hearted and free from distrust as
he is described, Somerset must have been aware
of some part of his danger. His friends amongst
the upper classes had ever been few and cold.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
The reformers, for whom he had done so much,
had begun to indulge doubts of his zeal. Become
possibly weary of persecution, he had tried to
make a way for Gardiner to leave the prison in
which he was languishing, and, alone of the Council,
had been in favour of permitting to Mary the
exercise of her religion. These facts were sufficient,
in the eyes of many, to justify the assertion made by
Burgoyne to Calvin that he had grown lukewarm,
and had scarcely anything less at heart than religion.</p>

<p>He was naturally the last to hear of the intrigues
against him, and of the accusations brought in his
absence from the Council-chamber. An attempt,
it is true, was made to warn him by Lord Chancellor
Rich, by means of a letter containing an account of
the proceedings which had taken place; but, carelessly
addressed only “To the Duke,” it was delivered, by
a blunder of the Chancellor’s servant, to Norfolk,
Somerset’s enemy. Surprised at the speedy return
of his messenger, Rich inquired where he had found
“the Duke.”</p>

<p>“In the Charter House,” was the reply, “on
the same token that he read it at the window and
smiled thereat.”</p>

<p>“But the Lord Rich,” adds Fuller, in telling
the story, “smiled not”; resigning his post on the
following day, on the plea of old age and a desire
to gain leisure to attend to his devotions, and
thereby escaping the dismissal which would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
resulted from a betrayal of the secrets of the
Council.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>By October 14 the Duke was cognisant to some
extent of the mischief that was a-foot, for it is stated
in the King’s journal that he sent for the Secretary
Cecil “to tell him that he suspected some ill. Mr.
Cecil answered that, if he were not guilty, he might
be of good courage; if he were, he had nothing
to say but to lament him.” It was not an encouraging
reply to an appeal for sympathy and
support, and must have been an earnest of the
attitude likely to be adopted towards the Duke
by the rest of his colleagues. Two days later
Edward’s journal notes his apprehension.</p>

<p>The issue of the struggle was nevertheless uncertain.
In spite of his unpopularity amongst the
nobles, and though, to judge by the entries in the
royal diary, the course of events was followed by his
nephew with cold indifference, Somerset was not without
his partisans. Constant to their old affection,
the attack upon him was watched by the common
people with breathless interest, accentuated by the
detestation universally felt for the man who had
planned his destruction. Hatred for Northumberland
joined hands with love for Somerset to range
them on his side. The political atmosphere was
charged with excitement. Could it be true that the
“good Duke” had designed the murder of his rival,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
who, whatever might be thought of him in other
respects, was one of the chief props of Protestantism?
Had the King, as some alleged, been in
danger? The trial would show; and when it
became known that the prisoner had been acquitted
of treason, and the axe was therefore, according to
custom, carried out of court, his cause was considered
to be won; a cry arose that the innocence of the
popular favourite had been established, and the
applause of the crowd testified to their rejoicing.
It had been premature. Acquitted of the principal
offence with which he stood charged, he was found
guilty of felony, and sentenced to death.</p>

<p>The verdict was received with ominous murmurs,
and, in a letter to Bullinger, Ulmis states that,
observing the grave and sorrowful aspect of the
audience, the Duke of Northumberland was wary
enough to take his cue from it, and to attempt to
propitiate in his own favour the discontented crowd.</p>

<p>“O Duke of Somerset,” he exclaimed from his
seat, “you see yourself brought into the utmost
danger, and that nothing but death awaits you. I
have once before delivered you from a similar
hazard of your life; and I will not now desist from
serving you, how little soever you may expect it.”
Let Somerset appeal to the royal clemency, and
Northumberland, forgiving him his offences, would
do all in his power to save him.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Northumberland’s tardy magnanimity fails to carry
conviction. But, besides his victim’s popularity in
the country, it was reported that the “King took
it not in good part,” and it was thought well to
delay the execution, by which means his supplanter
might gain credit for exercising his generosity by
an attempt to avert his doom. Christmas was at
hand, and it was arranged that the Duke should
remain in prison, under sentence of death, whilst
the feast was celebrated at Court.</p>

<p>In spite of the assertion that the young King had
not been unaffected by a tragedy that should have
touched him closely, there is nothing in his own
words to indicate any other attitude than that of
the indifferent spectator&mdash;an attitude recalling unpleasantly
the callousness shown by his father as
the women he had loved and the statesmen he had
trusted and employed were successively sent to the
block. Though, in justice to Edward, it should
be remembered that he had never loved his uncle,
there is something revolting in his casual mention
of the measures adopted against him.</p>

<p>“Little has been done since you went,” he wrote
to Barnaby Fitzpatrick, the comrade of his childish
days, now become his favourite, “but the Duke
of Somerset’s arraignment for felonious treason and
the muster of the newly erected gendarmery;”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> and
the journal wherein he traces the progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
trial, varying the narrative by the introduction of
other topics, such as the visit of the Queen-Dowager
of Scotland and the festivities in her honour, conveys
a similar impression of coldness. “And so he was
adjudged to be hanged,” he records in conclusion,
noting, with no expression of regret, the result of
the proceedings.</p>

<p>“It were well that he should die,” Edward had
told the Duke’s brother in those earlier childish
days when incited by the Admiral to rebel against
the strictness of the discipline enforced by the
Protector. But, under the mask of indifference,
it may be that misgivings awoke and made themselves
apparent to those who, watching him closely,
feared that ties of blood might vindicate their
strength, and that at their bidding, or through compassion,
he might interpose to avert the fate of one
of the only near relations who remained to him.
It appears to have been determined that the King’s
mind must be diverted from the subject; and whilst
the prisoner was awaiting in the Tower the execution
of his sentence, special merry-makings were arranged
by the men who had the direction of affairs at Greenwich,
where the court was to keep Christmas. Thus
it was hoped to “remove the fond talk out of men’s
mouths,” and to recreate and refresh the troubled
spirits of the young sovereign. A Lord of Misrule
was accordingly appointed, who, dubbed the Master
of the King’s Pastimes, took order for the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
amusement, though conducting himself more discreetly
than had been the wont of his predecessors,
and the festival was gaily observed. By these means,
says Holinshed, the minds and ears of murmurers
were well appeased, till it was thought well to
proceed to the business of executing judgment upon
the Duke.</p>

<p>In whatever light the ghastly contrast between the
uncle awaiting a bloody death in the Tower and the
noisy merry-making intended to drown the sound
of the passing-bell in the nephew’s ears may strike
students of a later day, it is likely that there was
nothing in it to affect painfully those who joined
in the proceedings. Life was little considered. Men
were daily accustomed to witness violent reverses
of fortune. The Duke had aimed over-high; he
was a danger to rivals whose turn it was to rise;
he must make way for others. He had moreover
been too deeply injured to forgive; and, to make
all safe, he must die. The reign of the Seymours
was at an end; that of Northumberland was
beginning. Two more years and their supplanter,
with Suffolk and his other adherents, would in
their turn have paid the penalty of a great ambition,
and, “with the sons of the Duke of Somerset standing
by,” would have followed the Lord Protector
to the grave.</p>

<p>There was none to prophesy their fate. Had it
been otherwise, it is not probable that a warning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
would have turned them from their purpose. For
they were reckless gamblers, and to foretell ruin
to a man who is staking his all upon a throw of
the dice is to speak to deaf ears.</p>

<p>So the merry Christmas passed, Jane&mdash;third in
succession to the throne&mdash;occupying a prominent
position at Court. And Aylmer, fearful lest the fruits
of his care should be squandered, looked on helplessly,
and besought Bullinger, on that 23rd of
December, to set a limit, for the benefit of a pupil
in danger, to the attention lawfully to be bestowed
on the world and its vanities; a letter from Haddon,
the Duke’s chaplain, following fast and betraying
his participation in the anxieties of his colleague by
an entreaty that, from afar, the eminent divine would
continue to exercise a beneficent influence upon his
master’s daughter.</p>

<p>Meantime the day had arrived when it was
considered safe to carry matters against the King’s
uncle to extremities, and on January 23, six weeks
after his trial, the Duke of Somerset was taken to
Tower Hill, to suffer death in the presence of a
vast crowd there assembled.</p>

<p>Till the last moment the throng had persisted in
hoping against hope that the life of the man they
loved might even now, at the eleventh hour, be
spared; and at one moment it seemed that they
were not to be disappointed. The Duke had
taken his place upon the scaffold, and had begun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
his speech, when an interruption occurred, occasioned,
as it afterwards proved, by an accidental
collision between the mass of spectators and a body
of troops who had received orders to be present
at the execution, and, finding themselves late, had
ridden hard and fast to make up for lost time.
This was the simple explanation of the occurrence;
but, to the excited mob gathered together, every
nerve strained and full of pity and fear and horror,
the sound of the thundering hoofs seemed something
supernatural and terrible. Was it a sign of
divine interposition?</p>

<p>“Suddenly,” recounts an eye-witness, “suddenly
came a wondrous fear upon the people ... by a
great sound which appeared unto many above in
the element as it had been the sound of gunpowder
set on fire in a close house bursting out, and by
another sound upon the ground as it had been the
sight of a great number of great horses running
on the people to overrun them; so great was the
sound of this that the people fell down one upon
the other, many with bills; and other ran this way,
some that way, crying aloud, ‘Jesus, save us! Jesus,
save us!’ Many of the people crying, ‘This way
they come, that way they come, away, away.’ And
I looked where one or other should strike me on
the head, so I was stonned [stunned?]. The people
being thus amazed, espies Sir Anthony Brown upon
a little nag riding towards the scaffold, and therewith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
burst out crying in a voice, ‘Pardon, pardon,
pardon!’ hurling up their caps and cloaks with
these words, saying, ‘God save the King! God save
the King!’ The good Duke all the while stayed,
and, with his cap in his hand, waited for the people
to come together.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>Whatever had been Sir Anthony’s errand, it had
not been one of mercy; and when the excitement
following upon the panic was calmed the doomed
man and the crowd were alike aware that the people
had been misled by hope, and that no pardon had
been brought. It is at such a moment that a man’s
mettle is shown. With admirable dignity Somerset
bore the blow. As for a moment he had participated
in the expectation of the cheering throng the colour
had flickered over his face; but, recovering himself
at once, he resumed his interrupted speech.</p>

<p>“Beloved friends,” he said, “there is no such
matter as you vainly hope and believe.” Let the
people accept the will of God, be quiet as he was
quiet, and yield obedience to King and Council.
A few minutes more and all was over. Somerset,
in the words of a chronicler, had taken his death
very patiently&mdash;with the strange patience in which
the victims of injustice scarcely ever failed; the
crowd, true to the last to their faith, pressing forward
to dip their handkerchiefs in his blood, as in
that of a martyr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
The laconic entry in the King’s journal, to the
effect that the Duke of Somerset had had his head
cut off on Tower Hill, presents a sharp contrast to
the popular emotion and grief. The deed was, at
all events, done; Northumberland had cleared his
most formidable competitor from his path, and
had no suspicion that the tragedy of that winter’s
day was in truth paving the way for his own ultimate
undoing.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">For</span> the moment master of the field, Northumberland
addressed himself sedulously to the
task of strengthening and consolidating the position
he had won. In the Council he had achieved
predominance, but the King’s minority would not
last for ever, and the necessity of laying the
foundation of a power that should continue when
Edward’s nominal sovereignty should have become
a real one was urgent.</p>

<p>The lad was growing up; nor were there
wanting moments causing those around him to
look on with disquietude to the day when the
nobles ruling in his name might be called upon to
give an account of their stewardship. A curious
anecdote tells how, as Northumberland stood one
day watching the King practising the art of archery,
the boy put a “sharp jest” upon him, not without
its significance.</p>

<p>“Well aimed, my liege,” said the Duke merrily,
as the arrow hit the white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
“But you aimed better,” retorted the lad, “when
you shot off the head of my uncle Somerset.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>It was a grim and ominous pleasantry, and in
the direct charge it contained of responsibility for
the death of Edward’s nearest of kin another shaft
besides the arrow may have been sent home.
The Tudors were not good at forgiving. Even
had the King seen the death of the Duke’s rival and
victim without regret, it was possible that he
would none the less owe a grudge to the man
to whom it was due; nor was Northumberland
without a reason for anticipating with uneasiness
the day when Edward, remembering
all, should hold the reins of Government in his
own hands.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was clearly his
interest to commend himself to the young sovereign,
and the system he pursued with regard to his
education and training were carefully adapted to
that purpose. Whilst the Protector had had the
arrangement of affairs, his nephew had been kept
closely to his studies; Northumberland, “a soldier
at heart and by profession, had him taught to
ride and handle his weapons,” the boy welcoming
the change, and, though not neglecting his books,
taking pleasure in every form of bodily exercise;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
not without occasional pangs of conscience, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
more time had been spent in pastime than he
“thought convenient.”</p>

<p>“We forget ourselves,” he would observe,
finding fault with himself sententiously in royal
phrase, upon such occasions, “that should not
lose <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">substantia pro accidente</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>It had been the Protector’s custom to place
little money at his nephew’s disposal, thus rendering
him comparatively straitened in the means of exercising
the liberality befitting his position; and
part of the boy’s liking for the Admiral had been
owing to the gifts contrasting with the niggardliness
of the elder brother. Profiting by his predecessor’s
mistakes, Northumberland’s was a different policy.
He supplied Edward freely with gold, encouraged
him to make presents, and to show himself a
King; acquainting him besides with public business,
and flattering him by asking his opinion upon
such matters.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>The Duke might have spared his pains. It
was not by Edward that he was to be called to
account. But at that time there were no signs
to indicate how futile was the toil of those who
were seeking to build their fortunes upon his
favour. A well-grown, handsome lad, his health
had given no special cause for anxiety up to the
spring of 1552. In the March of that year,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
however, a sharp and complicated attack of illness
laid him low and sowed the seeds of future delicacy.</p>

<p>“I fell sick of the smallpox and the measles,”
recorded the boy in his diary. “April 15th the
Parliament broke up because I was sick and unable
to go abroad.”</p>

<p>To us, who read the laconic entry in the light
thrown upon it by future events, it marks the
beginning of the end&mdash;not only the end of
the King’s short life, but the beginning of the
drama in which many other actors were to be
involved and were to meet their doom. As yet
none of the anxious watchers suspected that
death had set his broad arrow upon the lad; and
in the summer he had so far recovered as to be
sending a blithe account to Barnaby Fitzpatrick,
then in France, of a progress he had made in the
country, and its attendant enjoyments. Whilst his
old playfellow had been occupied in killing his enemies,
and sore skirmishing and divers assaults, the
King had been killing wild beasts, having pleasant
journeys and good fare, viewing fair countries, and
seeking rather to fortify his own than to spoil another
man’s<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>&mdash;so he wrote gaily to Fitzpatrick.</p>

<p>Meantime his illness, with the dissolution of
Parliament consequent upon it, had probably
emptied London; the Suffolk family, with others,
returning to their country home. In July Lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Jane was on a visit to her cousin, the Princess
Mary, at Newhall; when, once more, an indiscreet
speech&mdash;a scoff, on this occasion, directed against
the outward tokens of that Catholic faith to which
Mary was so vehemently loyal&mdash;may, repeated to
her hostess, have served to irritate her towards the
offender against the rules of courtesy and good
taste. Under other circumstances, it might have
been passed over by the older woman with a
smile; but subjected to annoyance and petty persecution
by reason of her religion and saddened
and embittered by illness and misfortune, the
trifling instance of ill-manners on the part of a
malapert child of fifteen may have had its share
in accentuating a latent antagonism.</p>

<p>In the course of the previous year a controversy
had reached its height which had been more or
less imminent since the statute enjoining the use
of the new Prayer-book had been passed, a work
said to have afforded the King&mdash;then eleven
years of age&mdash;“great comfort and quietness of
mind.” From that time forward&mdash;the decree had
become law in 1549&mdash;there had been trouble in
the royal family, as might be expected when
opinion on vital points of religion, the burning
question of the day, was widely and violently
divergent, and friends and advisers were ever at
hand to fan the flame of discord in their own
interest or that of their party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
No one could be blind to the fact that the ardent
Catholicism of the Princess Mary, next in succession
to the throne, constituted a standing menace to
the future of religion as recently by law established,
and to the durability of the work hastily carried
through in creating a new Church on a new basis.
Furthermore it was considered that her present
attitude of open and determined opposition to the
decree passed by Parliament was a cause of scandal
in the realm. It was certainly one of annoyance
to the King and Council.</p>

<p>Cranmer would probably have liked to keep the
peace. An honest man, but no fanatic and holding
moderate views, he might have been inclined, having
got what he personally wanted, to adopt a policy of
conciliation. Affairs had gone well with him; his
friends were in power; and, if he failed to inspire
the foreign divines and their English disciples
with entire trust, it was admitted in 1550 by John
Stumpius, of that school, that things had been put
upon a right footing. “There is,” he added, “the
greatest hope as to religion, for the Archbishop
of Canterbury has lately married a wife.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>Matters being thus comfortably arranged, Cranmer,
if he had had his way, might have preferred to leave
them alone. But what could one man do in the
interests of peace, when Churchmen and laity were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
alike clamouring for war, when the King’s Council
were against the concession of any one point at issue,
and the King himself had composed, before he was
twelve years old, and “sans l’aide de personne
vivant,” a treatise directed against the supremacy of
the Pope? To the honour of the King’s counsellors,
few victims had suffered the supreme penalty during
his reign on account of their religious opinions;<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
but Gardiner and Bonner, as well as Bishops Day
and Heath, were in prison, and if the lives of the
adherents of the ancient faith were spared, no other
mitigation of punishment or indulgence was to be
expected by them.</p>

<p>Under pressure from the Emperor the principal
offender had been at first granted permission to
continue the practice of her religion. But when
peace with France rendered a rupture with Charles
a less formidable contingency than before, it was
decided that renewed efforts should be made to
compel the Princess Mary to bow to the fiat of
King and Council. Love of God and affection for
his sister forbade her brother, he declared, to
tolerate her obstinacy longer, the intimation being
accompanied by an offer of teachers who should
instruct her ignorance and refute her errors.</p>

<p>Mary was a match for both King and Council.
In an interview with the Lords she told them that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
her soul was God’s, and that neither would she
change her faith nor dissemble her opinions; the
Council replying by a chilling intimation that
her faith was her own affair, but that she must
obey like a subject, not rule like a sovereign. The
Princess, however, had a card to play unsuspected by
her adversaries. The dispute had taken place on
August 18. On the 19th the Council was unpleasantly
surprised by a strong measure on the part
of the imperial ambassador, in the shape of a
declaration of war in case his master’s cousin was
not permitted the exercise of her religion.</p>

<p>The Council were in a difficulty. War with the
Emperor, at that moment, and without space for
preparation, would have been attended with grave
inconvenience. On the other hand Edward’s tender
conscience had outrun that of his ministers, and had
become so difficult to deal with that all the persuasions
of the Primate and two other Bishops were
needed to convince the boy, honest and zealous in
his intolerance, that “to suffer or wink at [sin] for a
time might be borne, so all haste possible was
used.”</p>

<p>A temporising answer was therefore returned
to the imperial ambassador, “all haste possible”
being made in removing English stores from
Flanders, so that, in case of a rupture, they
might not fall into Charles’s hands. This accomplished,
fresh and stringent measures were taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to compel the Princess’s obedience; her chief
chaplain was committed to the Tower, charged
with having celebrated Mass in his mistress’s house,
and three of the principal officers of her household
were sent to join him there as a punishment for
declining to use coercion to prevent a recurrence of
the offence.</p>

<p>An interview followed between Mary and a
deputation of members of the Council, who visited
her with the object of enforcing the King’s orders.
The Princess received her guests with undisguised
impatience; requested them to be brief; and, having
listened to what they had to say, answered shortly
that she would lay her head upon a block&mdash;no idle
rhetoric in those days&mdash;sooner than use any other
form of service than that in use at her father’s death;
when her brother was of full age she was ready
to obey his commands, but at present&mdash;good,
sweet King!&mdash;he could not be a judge in such
matters. Her chaplains, for the rest, could do as
they pleased in the matter of saying Mass, “but
none of your new service shall be used in my house,
or I will not tarry in it.”</p>

<p>Thus the controversy practically ended. The
Council dared not proceed to extremities against the
Emperor’s cousin, and tacitly agreed to let her alone,
having supplied her with one more bitter memory to
add to the account which was to be lamentably
settled in the near future.</p>

<span class="subhead">1552</span>

<span class="subhead">Lady Jane’s correspondence with Bullinger&mdash;Illness of the Duchess
of Suffolk&mdash;Haddon’s difficulties&mdash;Ridley’s visit to Princess
Mary&mdash;the English Reformers&mdash;Edward fatally ill&mdash;Lady Jane’s
character and position.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> removal of the two Seymour brothers,
whilst it had left Northumberland predominant,
had also increased the importance of the
Duke of Suffolk. Both by reason of the position
he personally filled, and owing to his connection,
through his wife, with the King, he was second to
none in the State save the man to whom Somerset’s
fall was due and who had succeeded to his power.
He shared Northumberland’s prominence, as he was
afterwards to share his ruin; and, as one of the chief
props of Protestantism, he and his family continued
to be objects of special interest to the divines of that
persuasion, foreign and English.</p>

<p>Lady Jane, as before, was in communication with
the learned Bullinger, and in the same month&mdash;July
1552&mdash;that her visit had been paid to the
Princess Mary she was sending him another letter,
dated from Bradgate, expressing her gratitude for
the “great friendship he desired to establish between
them, and acknowledging his many favours.” After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
a second perusal of his latest letter&mdash;since a single
one had not contented her&mdash;the benefit derived from
it had surpassed that to be obtained from the best
authors, and in studying Hebrew she meant to
pursue the method he recommended.</p>

<p>In August more pressing interests must have
taken the place of study, for at Richmond in Surrey
her mother was attacked by a sickness threatening
at one time to prove fatal.</p>

<p>“This shall be to advertise you,” wrote the
Duchess’s husband, hastily summoned from London,
to Cecil, “that my sudden departing from the Court
was for that I had received letters of the state my wife
was in, who I assure you is more liker to die than to
live. I never saw a sicker creature in my life than she
is. She hath three diseases.... These three being
enclosed in one body, it is to be feared that death
must needs follow. By your most assured and loving
cousin, who, I assure you, is not a little troubled.”</p>

<p>His anxiety was soon relieved. The Duchess
was not only to outlive, but, in her haste to
replace him, was to show little respect for his
memory. She must quickly have got the better of
her present threefold disorder, for in the course of
the same month a letter was sent from Richmond
by James Haddon, the domestic chaplain, to Bullinger,
making no mention of any cause of uneasiness as to
the physical condition of his master’s wife. He was
preoccupied by other matters, disquieted by scruples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of conscience, and glad to unburthen himself to the
universal referee with regard to certain difficulties
attending his position in the Duke’s household.</p>

<p>It was true that he might have hesitated to communicate
the fears and misgivings by which he was
beset to a guide at so great a distance, had not John
ab Ulmis&mdash;who, as portrayed by these letters, was
somewhat of a busybody, eager to bring all his friends
into personal relations, and above all to magnify the
authority and importance of his master in spiritual
things&mdash;just come in and encouraged him to write,
stating that it would give Bullinger great satisfaction
to be informed of the condition of religion in
England, and likewise&mdash;a more mundane curiosity&mdash;of
that of the Suffolk household. Entering into
a description of both, therefore, in a missive containing
some three thousand words, Haddon fully
detailed the sorrows and perplexities attending the
exercise of the office of chaplain, even in the most
orthodox and pious of houses.</p>

<p>After dealing with the first and important subject
of religion at large, he proceeded to treat of
the more complicated question&mdash;the condition of the
ducal household, and especially the duties attaching
to his own post.</p>

<p>Of the general regulation of the house, Ulmis, he
said, was more capable than he of giving an account.
It was rather to be desired that Bullinger should
point out the method he would recommend. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
upon one point Haddon was anxious to obtain the
advice of so eminent a counsellor, and he went on
to explain at length the case of conscience by which
he had been troubled. This was upon the question
of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of conniving,
by silence, at the practice of gambling.</p>

<p>The situation was this. The Duke and Duchess
had strictly forbidden the members of their household
to play at cards or dice for money. So far
they had the entire approval of their chaplain. But&mdash;and
here came in Haddon’s cause of perplexity&mdash;the
Duke himself and his most honourable lady,
with their friends&mdash;perhaps, too, their daughter,
though there is no mention of her&mdash;not only claimed
a right to play in their private apartments, but also
to play for money. The divergence between precept
and practice&mdash;common in all ages&mdash;was grievous
to the chaplain, weighted with the responsibility
for the spiritual and moral welfare of the whole
establishment, from his “patron” the Duke, down
to the lowest of the menials. At wearisome and
painstaking length he recapitulated the arguments
he was wont to employ in his remonstrances against
the gambling propensities he deplored, retailing, as
well, the arguments with which the offenders met
them. “In this manner and to this effect,” he says,
“the dispute is often carried on.”</p>

<p>During the past months matters had reached a
climax. As late as up to the previous Christmas he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
had confined himself to administering private
rebukes; but, perceiving that his words had taken
no effect, he had forewarned the culprits that a public
reprimand would follow a continued disregard of his
monitions. Upon this he had been relieved to perceive
that there had been for a time a cessation of the
reprehensible form of amusement, and had cherished
a hope that all would be well. It had been a vain
one. Christmas had come round&mdash;the season marked
by mummeries and wickedness of every kind, when
persons especially served the devil in imitation, as it
seemed, of the ancient Saturnalia; and though this
was happily not the case in the Suffolk family, Duke
and Duchess had joined in the general backsliding
to the extent of returning to their old evil habit.
Such being the case, Haddon had felt that he had
no choice but to carry out his threat.</p>

<p>In his Christmas sermon he had taken occasion to
administer a reproof as to the general fashion of keeping
the feast, including in his rebuke, “though in
common and general terms,” those who played cards
for money. No one in the household was at a loss
to fix upon the offenders at whom the shaft was
directed. The Duke’s servants, if they followed his
example, took care never to be detected in so doing;
and, accepting the reprimand as addressed to themselves,
the Duke and Duchess took it in bad part,
arguing that Haddon would have performed all that
duty required of him by a private remonstrance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
From that time, offence having been given by his plain
speech, the chaplain had returned to his old custom
of administering only private rebukes; thus conniving,
in a measure, at the practice he condemned,
lest loss of influence in matters of greater moment
should follow. “I bear with it,” he sighed, “as a
man who holds a wolf by the ears.” Conscience
was, however, uneasy, and he begged Bullinger to
advise in the matter and to determine how far such
concessions might be lawfully made.</p>

<p>Looking impartially at the question, it says much
for the Duke’s good temper and toleration that the
worthy Haddon continued to fill his post, and that
when, a few months later, he was promoted to be
Dean of Exeter, he wrote that the affection between
himself and his master was so strong that the connection
would even then not be altogether severed.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
His attitude is a curious and interesting example of
the position and status of a chaplain in his day, being
wholly that of a dependant, and yet carrying with it
duties and rights strongly asserted on the one side
and not disallowed upon the other.</p>

<p>The Duchess, having recovered from her illness,
had taken her three daughters to visit their cousin
Mary, and when the younger children were sent
home Jane remained behind at St. John’s, Clerkenwell,
the London dwelling of the Princess, until her father
came to fetch wife and daughter away. That the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
whole family had been thus entertained indicates
that they were at this time on a friendly footing
with the Princess. But though the Duke of
Suffolk was doubtless alive to the necessity of
maintaining amicable relations, so far as it was
possible, with his wife’s cousin and the next heir
to the crown, it must have been no easy matter,
at a time when party spirit ran so high, for one
of the chief recognised supporters of Protestantism
to continue on terms of cordiality with the head and
hope of the Catholic section of the nation. Mary was
not becoming more conciliatory in her bearing as time
went on, and an account of a visit paid her by Ridley,
now Bishop of London in place of Bonner, deprived
and in prison, is illustrative of her present
attitude.</p>

<div id="ip_184" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>PRINCESS MARY, AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-EIGHT.</p></div></div>

<p>It was to Hunsdon that, in the month of September,
Ridley came to pay his respects to the King’s sister,
cherishing, it may be, a secret hope that where King
and Council had failed, he might succeed; and his
courteous reception by the officers of her household
was calculated to encourage his sanguine anticipations.
Mary too, when, at eleven o’clock, he was admitted
to her presence, conversed with her guest right
pleasantly for a quarter of an hour, telling him that
she remembered the time when he had acted as
chaplain to her father, and inviting him to stay to
dinner. It was not until after the meal was ended
that the Bishop unfolded the true object of his visit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
It was not one of simple courtesy; he had come, he
said, to do his duty by her as her diocesan, and to
preach before her on the following Sunday.</p>

<p>If Mary prepared for battle, she answered at first
with quiet dignity. It was observed that she flushed;
her response, however, was merely to bid him “make
the answer to that himself.” When, refusing to
take the hint, the Bishop continued to urge his
point, she spoke more plainly.</p>

<p>“I pray you, make the answer (as I have said) to
this matter yourself,” she repeated, “for you know the
answer well enough. But if there be no remedy but
I must make you answer, this shall be your answer:
the door of the parish church adjoining shall be open
for you if you come, and you may preach if you
list; but neither I nor any of mine shall hear you.”</p>

<p>To preach to an empty church, or to a handful of
country yokels, would not have answered the episcopal
purpose; and Ridley was plainly losing his temper.</p>

<p>He hoped, he said, she would not refuse to hear
God’s word. The Princess answered with a scoff.
She did not know what they now called God’s word;
she was sure it was not the same as in her father’s
time&mdash;to whom, it will be remembered, the Bishop
had been chaplain.</p>

<p>The dispute was becoming heated. God’s word,
Ridley retorted, was the same at all times, but
had been better understood and practised in some
ages than in others. To this Mary replied by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
personal thrust. He durst not, she told him, for
his ears, have avowed his present faith in King
Henry’s time; then&mdash;asking a question to which she
must have known the answer&mdash;was he of the Council?
she demanded. The inquiry was probably intended
as a reminder that his rights did not extend to interference
with the King’s sister, as well as to elicit, as it
did, the confession that he held no such post.</p>

<p>“You might well enough, as the Council goeth
nowadays,” observed Mary carelessly; proceeding,
at parting, to thank the Bishop for his gentleness in
coming to see her, “but for your offering to preach
before me I thank you never a whit.”</p>

<p>In the presence of his hostess the discomfited
guest appears to have kept his temper under control,
but, having duly drunk of the stirrup cup presented
to him by her steward, Sir Thomas Wharton, he gave
free expression to his sentiments.</p>

<p>“Surely I have done amiss,” he said, looking
“very sadly,” and explaining, in answer to Wharton’s
interrogation, that he had erred in having drunk
under a roof where God’s word was rejected. He
should rather have shaken the dust off his feet for
a testimony against the house and departed instantly,
he told the listeners assembled to speed him on
his way&mdash;whose hair, says Heylyn, in relating this
story, stood on end with his denunciations.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
If scenes of this kind were not adapted to promote
good feeling between belligerents in high places,
neither was the spirit of the dominant party in the
country one to conciliate opposition. It is not
easy, as the figures of the English pioneers of
Protestantism pass from time to time across the
stage, in these years of their first triumph, to do
them full justice. To judge a man by one period of
his life, whether it is youth or manhood or old age,
is scarcely fairer than to pronounce upon the colour
and pattern of an eastern carpet, only one square yard
of it being visible. The adherents of the new faith
are here necessarily represented in a single phase,
that of prosperity. At the top of the wave,
they are seen at their worst, assertive, triumphant,
intolerant and self-satisfied, the bull-dogs of the
Reformation, only withheld by the leash from worrying
their fallen antagonist. Thus, for the most
part, they appear in Edward’s reign. And yet these
men, a year or two later, were many of them
capable of an undaunted courage, an impassioned belief
in the common Lord of Protestant and Catholic, and
a power of endurance, which have graven their
names upon the national roll-call of heroes.</p>

<p>Meantime, more and more, the King’s precarious
health was suggestive of disturbing contingencies.
It may be that, as some assert, his uncle’s death, once
become irrevocable, had preyed upon his spirits&mdash;that
he “mourned, and soon missed the life of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Protector, thus unexpectedly taken away, who, now
deprived of both uncles, howsoever the time were
passed with pastimes, plays and shows, to drive
away dumps, yet ever the remembrance of them sat
so near his heart that lastly he fell sick....”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> But
though it is possible that, as his strength declined,
matters he had taken lightly weighed upon his
spirits, it is not necessary to seek other than
natural and constitutional causes for a failure of
health. That failure must have filled many hearts
with forebodings.</p>

<p>There had been no attempt hitherto to ignore or
deny the position occupied by Mary as next heir to
the throne. When, at the New Year, she visited
her brother, the honours rendered to her were a
recognition of her rights, and the Northumberlands
and Suffolks occupied a foremost place amongst the
“vast throng” who rode with her through the city
or met her at the palace gate and brought her to
the presence-chamber of the King. Before the next
New Year’s Day came round Edward was to be in
his grave; Mary would fill his place; and the little
cousin Jane, now spending a gay Christmas with
her father’s nephews and wards, the young
Willoughbys, at Tylsey, would be awaiting her doom
in the Tower.</p>

<p>The shadow was already darkening over the
King. It is said that the seeds of his malady had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
been sown by over-heating in his sports, during
the progress of which he had sent so joyous an
account to Fitzpatrick.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Soon after his sister’s
visit he caught a bad cold, and unfavourable symptoms
appeared. He had, however, youth in his
favour, and few at first anticipated how speedy
would be the end. Vague disquiet nevertheless
quickly passed into definite alarm. In February
the patient’s condition was such that Northumberland,
who of all men had most at stake, summoned
no less than six physicians, desiring them to
institute an examination and to declare upon their
oath, first, whether they considered the King’s
disease mortal, and, if so, how long he was likely to
live. The reply made by the doctors was that the
malady was incurable, and that the patient might
live until the following September.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Northumberland
had obtained his answer; it was for him to
take measures accordingly.</p>

<p>In March Edward’s last Parliament met and ended.
“The King being a little diseased by cold-taking,”
recorded a contemporary chronicle,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> “it was not
meet for his Grace to ride to Westminster in the
air,”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> and on the 31st&mdash;it was Good Friday&mdash;the
Upper House waited upon him at Whitehall,
Edward in his royal robes receiving the Lords<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Spiritual and Temporal. At seven that evening
Parliament was dissolved.</p>

<p>Many hearts, loyal and true and pitiful, will have
grieved at the signs of their King’s decay. But to
Northumberland, watching them with the keenness
lent by personal interest, personal ambition, and
possibly by a consciousness of personal peril, they
must have afforded absorbing matter of preoccupation.
The exact time at which the designs
by which the Duke trusted to turn the boy’s death
to his advantage rather than to his ruin took definite
shape and form must remain to some extent undetermined&mdash;his
plans were probably decided by the
verdict given by the doctors in February; it is
certain that in the course of the spring they were
elaborated, and that in them Lady Jane Grey,
ignorant and unsuspicious, was a factor of primary
importance. She was to be the figure-head of the
Duke’s adventurous vessel.</p>

<p>The precise date of her birth is not known, but
she was now in her sixteenth or seventeenth year&mdash;a
sorrowful one for her and for all she loved. Childhood
was a thing she had left behind; she was
touching upon her brief space of womanhood; a
few months later and that too would be over;
she would have paid the penalty for the schemes
and ambitions of others.</p>

<p>The eulogies of her panegyrists have, as a natural
effect of extravagant praise, done in some sort an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
injury to this little white saint of the English
Reformation. We do not readily believe in miracles;
nor do infant prodigies either in the sphere of morals
or attainments attract us. Yet, setting aside the
tragedy of her end, there is something that appeals
for pity in the very precocity upon which her contemporaries
are fond of dwelling, testifying as it does
to a wasted childhood, to a life robbed of its natural
early heritage of carelessness and grace. To have had
so short a time to spend on the green earth, and to
have squandered so large a portion of it amongst
dusty folios, and in the acquirement of learning; to
have pored over parchments while sun and air,
flowers and birds and beasts&mdash;all that should make
the delight of a child’s life, the pageant of a child’s
spring, was passed by as of no account; further, to
have grown up versed in the technicalities of barren
theological debate, the simple facts of Christ’s religion
overlaid and obscured by the bitterness of professional
controversialists,&mdash;almost every condition of
her brief existence is an appeal for compassion, and
Jane, from her blood-stained grave, cries out that
she had not only been robbed of life by her
enemies, but of a childhood by her friends.</p>

<p>To a figure defaced by flattery and adulation,
whose very virtues and gifts were made to minister
to party ends, it is difficult to restore the original
brightness and beauty which nevertheless belonged
to it. But here and there in the pages of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Italian evangelist, Michel Angelo Florio, who was
personally acquainted with her, pictures are to
be found which, drawn with tender touches, set
the girl more vividly before us than is done by
the stilted commendations of English devotees or
German doctors of theology. Many times, he
says&mdash;times when it may be hoped she had forgotten
that there were opponents to be argued with
or heretics to be convinced or doctrinal subtleties
to be set forth&mdash;she would speak of the Word of
God and almost preach it to those who served
her;<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> and Florio himself, recounting the indignities
and insults he had suffered by reason of his
opinions, had seen her weep with pity, so that he
well knew how much she had true religion at heart.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Her attendants, too&mdash;in days when her melancholy
end had caused each trifling incident to be treasured
like a relic by those to whom she had been dear&mdash;related
that she did not esteem rank or wealth or
kingdom worth a straw in comparison with the knowledge
God had granted to her of His only Son.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
It must be remembered that in no long time she
was to give proof, by her fashion of meeting death, that
these phrases were no repetition of a lesson learned
by rote, no empty and conventional form of words,
but the true and sincere confession of a living faith.</p>

<span class="subhead">The King dying&mdash;Noailles in England&mdash;Lady Jane married to
Guilford Dudley&mdash;Edward’s will&mdash;Opposition of the law

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> King was becoming rapidly worse, and as
his malady increased upon him, strange suspicions
were afloat amongst the people, their hatred
to Northumberland giving its colour to their
explanation of the situation. He himself, or those
upon whom he could count, were ever with the sick
boy, and hints were uttered&mdash;as was sure to be the
case&mdash;of poison. For this, murmured the populace,
had the King’s uncles been removed, his faithful
nobles disgraced; and the condition of public opinion
caused the Duke, alarmed at its hostility, to publish
it abroad that Edward was better.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>In May a rally appears to have in fact taken place,
giving rise in some quarters to false hopes of recovery,
and Mary wrote to offer her congratulations
to her brother upon the improvement in his health.
On May 13 the new French ambassador, Noailles,
whose audience had been deferred from day to day,
was informed by the Council that their master was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
so much better that he would doubtless be admitted
to the royal presence in the course of a few days.
The doctors told a different story, and Noailles
believed the doctors. A diplomatist himself, he
knew the uses of lying perhaps too well to condemn
it severely. That the King was dying was practically
certain, and though those whose object it was
to conceal the fact lest measures should be concerted
to ensure the succession of the rightful heir, might
do their best to disguise the fact, the truth must
become known before long.</p>

<p>Meantime the French envoy, in the interest of
the reformed party in England&mdash;not by reason of
their religion, but as opposed to Mary, the Emperor’s
cousin&mdash;was quite willing to play into Northumberland’s
hands, and to assist him in the work of
spreading abroad the report that the King’s malady
was yielding to treatment. He and his colleagues
were accordingly conducted to an apartment near
to the presence-chamber, where they were left for a
certain time alone, in order to convey the impression
that they had been personally received by the
sovereign. Some days later it was confessed, but as
a peril past, that Edward had been seriously ill. He
was then stated to be out of danger, and the
ambassadors were admitted to his presence, finding
him very weak, and coughing much.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
The rally had been of short duration. Hope of
recovery had, in truth, been abandoned; and those
it concerned so intimately were forced to face the
situation to be created by his death. It was a
situation momentous alike to men whose fortunes
had been staked upon the young King’s life, and to
others honestly and sincerely solicitous regarding
the welfare of the realm and the consequences to
the new religion should his eldest sister succeed to
the throne.</p>

<p>Every one of the Lords of the Council and
officers of the Crown, with almost all the Bishops,
save those who had suffered captivity and deprivation,
had personal reasons for apprehension. Scarcely
a single person of influence or power could count
upon being otherwise than obnoxious to the heir
to the crown. That most of them would be displaced
from their posts was to be expected. Some
at least must have felt that property and life
hung in the balance. But it was Northumberland
who, as he had most to lose, had most to fear.
The practical head of the State, and wielding
a power little less than that of Somerset, he had
amassed riches and offices to an amount bearing witness
to his rapacity. In matters of religion he had
been as strong, though less sincere, in his opposition
to the Church claiming Mary’s allegiance as his
predecessor. During the preceding autumn the
iconoclastic work of destruction had been carried on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
in the metropolitan Cathedral; the choir, where
the high altar had been accustomed to stand, had
been broken down and the stone-work destroyed.<a  href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
Gardiner and Bonner, who, as prominent sufferers
for the Catholic cause, would have Mary’s ear, were
in prison. For all this Northumberland, with the
King’s Council as aiders and abettors, was responsible.
Not a single claim could be advanced to the
liking or toleration of the woman presently to become
head of the State. If safety was to be ensured
to the advisers of her brother, steps must be taken
at once for that purpose. Northumberland and
Suffolk set themselves to do so.</p>

<p>It was on May 18 that Noailles and his colleagues
had been at length permitted to pay their respects to
the sick boy. On Whitsunday, the 23rd&mdash;the date,
though not altogether certain, is probable&mdash;three
marriages were celebrated at Durham House, the
London dwelling-place of the Duke of Northumberland.
On that day the eldest daughter of the Duke
of Suffolk became the wife of Lord Guilford
Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland’s fourth and,
some say, favourite son; her sister Katherine was
bestowed upon Lord Herbert, the earl of Pembroke’s
heir&mdash;to be repudiated by him the following year&mdash;and
Lady Katherine Dudley, Northumberland’s
daughter, was married to Lord Hastings.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>The object of the threefold ceremony was clear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
The main cause of it, and of the haste shown in
carrying it through, was a dying boy, whose life was
flickering out a few miles distant at Greenwich. It
behoved his two most powerful subjects, Northumberland
and Suffolk, to strengthen their position as
speedily as might be, and by this means it was hoped
to accomplish that object.</p>

<p>The place chosen for the celebration of the
weddings might have served&mdash;perhaps it did&mdash;to
host and guests as a reminder of the perils of
those who climbed too high. Durham House,
appropriated in his days of prosperity by Somerset&mdash;to
the indignation of Elizabeth, who laid claim
to the property&mdash;had been forfeited to the Crown
upon his attainder, and was the dwelling of his
more fortunate rival; and, as if to drive the lesson
further home, the very cloth of gold and silver lent
from the royal coffers to deck the bridal party
had been likewise drawn from the possessions of the
ill-starred Duke. The dead furnished forth the festal
array of the living.</p>

<p>That day, with its splendid ceremonial&mdash;the
marriages took place with much magnificence in the
presence of a great assembly, including the principal
personages of the realm&mdash;presents a grim and striking
contrast to what was to follow. None were present,
so far as we know, with the eyes of a seer, to discern
the thin red ring foretelling the proximate fate of
the girl who played the most prominent part in it, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
to recognise in death the presiding genius of the
pageant. Yet the destiny said in old days to dog
the steps of those doomed to a violent death and
to be present at their side from the cradle to the
grave must have stood by many, besides the bride,
who joined in the proceedings on that Whitsunday.
Where would Northumberland be that day year?
or Suffolk? or young Guilford Dudley? or, a little
later, the Bishop who tied the knots?</p>

<p>How Jane played her part we can only guess, or
what she had thought of the arrangement, hurriedly
concluded, by which her future was handed over to
the keeping of her boy husband. Whether willing
or unwilling, she had no choice but to obey, to
accept the bridegroom chosen for her&mdash;a tall, handsome
lad of seventeen or nineteen, it is not clear
which&mdash;and to make the best of it. Rosso indeed,
deriving his information from Michele, Venetian
ambassador in London, and Bodoaro, Venetian
ambassador to Charles V., states that after much
resistance, urged by her mother and beaten by her
father, she had consented to their wishes. It may
have been true; and, standing at the altar, her
thoughts may have wandered from the brilliant scene
around her to the room at Greenwich, where the
husband proposed for her in earlier days was dying.
She might have been Edward’s wife, had he lived.
She can scarcely have failed to have been aware of
the hopes and designs of her father, of those of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
dead Admiral, and of others; she had, in a measure,
been brought up in the expectation of filling a throne.
But the plan was forgotten now. Edward was to be
the husband neither of Jane nor of that other
cousin, not of royal blood, the daughter of his
sometime Protector, whose father was dead and
mother in the Tower; nor yet of the foreign bride,
well stuffed and jewelled, of whom he had himself
bragged. He was dying, like any other boy of
no royal race, upon whose life no momentous
issues hung. From his sick-bed he had taken a keen
interest in what was going forward, appearing, says
Heylyn, as forward in the marriages as if he had been
one of the principals in the plot against him.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> He
might be fond of Jane, but even had he loved her&mdash;which
there is nothing to show&mdash;he was too far
within the shadow of the grave to feel any jealousy
in seeing her handed over to another bridegroom.</p>

<p>At the demeanour of the little victim of the
Whitsun sacrifice we can but guess. Grave and
serious we picture her, as it was her wont to be,
with the steadfast face depicted by the painters of
the day&mdash;far, in spite of Seymour’s boast, from being
“as handsome as any lady in England,” but with a
purity and simplicity, a stillness and repose, restful
to those who looked into the quiet eyes and marked
the tranquillity of the countenance. Did she, in
her inward cogitations, divine that there was danger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
ahead? If so we can fancy she was ready to face
it. Were it God’s will, then let it come. Peril
was the anteroom, death the portal, of the eternal
city&mdash;the heavenly Jerusalem in which she believed.</p>

<p>Such was the image printed upon the time by the
woman-child who was never to know maturity, as it
lived in the tender and loving remembrance of her
contemporaries, the delicately sculptured figure of
a saint in the temples of the iconoclasts.</p>

<p>By the country at large the sudden marriages
were regarded with suspicion. “The noise of these
marriages bred such amazement in the hearts of the
common people, apt enough in themselves to speak
the worst of Northumberland, that there was nothing
left unsaid which might serve to show their hatred
against him, or express their pity for the King.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
Overbearing and despotic, the merciless “bear of
Warwick,” as he was nicknamed, was so detested
that by some the failure of his scheme was afterwards
ascribed rather to his unpopularity than to
love for Mary. Yet it was Northumberland who,
with the blindness born of a sanguine ambition, was
to trust, six weeks later, to the populace to join
with him in dispossessing the King’s sister, for
whom they had always shown affection, and in
placing his daughter-in-law and her boy-husband
upon the throne. So glaring a misapprehension of
the situation demands explanation, and it is partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
supplied by a French appreciation of the Duke’s
character. According to M. Griffet, he was more
heedful to conceal his own sentiments than capable
of discerning those of others; a man of ambition
who neither knew whom to trust nor whom to
suspect; who, blinded by presumption, was therefore
easily deceived, and who nevertheless believed
himself to possess to the highest degree the gift of
deceiving all the world.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Such as he was, he had
deceived himself to his undoing.</p>

<p>Meantime Lady Jane’s marriage had made for
the moment little change in her manner of life.
She had answered the purpose for which she was
required, and was permitted temporarily to retire
behind the scenes. It is said&mdash;and there is nothing
unlikely in the assertion&mdash;that, the ceremony over
and obedience having been rendered to her parents’
behest, she entreated that she might continue with
her mother for the present. She and her new
husband were so young, she pleaded. Her request
was granted. She was Guilford Dudley’s wife,
could be the wife of no other man, and that was,
for the moment, sufficient.</p>

<p>There was much to think of, much to do.
Measures had to be taken to keep the King’s sisters
at a distance, lest his old affection, for Elizabeth in
particular, reawakening might frustrate the designs
of those bent upon moulding events to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
advantage. Above all, there was the pressing
necessity of inducing the King to exclude them by
will from their rightful heritage. On June 16
Noailles had again been conferring with the doctors,
and had learnt that, in their opinion, Edward could
not live till August. Ten days later Northumberland
came from Greenwich to visit the envoy, and
to prevent his going to Court. He then told the
Frenchman that, nine days earlier, the King had
executed his will in favour of the Duke’s daughter-in-law,
Lady Jane<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>&mdash;“qui est vertueuse, sage, et
belle,” reported the envoy to his master some three
weeks later.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>Of the manner in which the will had been obtained
full information is available. It was not out
of love for Northumberland that Edward had
yielded to his representations. The Throckmorton
MS.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> asserts that Edward abhorred the Duke on
account of his uncle’s death. Sir Nicholas
Throckmorton, in attendance on the King, should
be a good authority; on the other hand, he
was opposed to the Duke’s designs. Whether or
not the latter was personally distasteful to the boy,
it was no difficult matter to represent the situation
in a fashion to lead him to believe the sole alternative
was the course suggested to him. Conscientious,
pious, scrupulous to a fault, and worn by disease,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the future of religion could be made to hang upon
his fiat, and the thought of Mary, a devout Catholic,
or even Elizabeth, who might marry a foreign prince,
seated upon the throne, filled him with apprehensions
for the welfare of a people for whom he felt himself
responsible. Yet he, with little to love, had loved
both his sisters, and the thought of the sick lad,
torn between duty and affection, a tool in the hands
of unprincipled and ambitious men who could play
on his sensitive conscience and over-strained nerves
at will, and turn his piety to their advantage, is a
painful one.</p>

<p>The Duke’s arguments lay ready to his hand.
Religion was in danger, the Church set up by
Edward in jeopardy; the work that he had done
might be destroyed as soon as he was in his grave.
How could he answer it before God were he, who
was able to avert it, to permit so great an evil?
The remedy was clear. Let him pass over his
sisters, already pronounced severally illegitimate by
unrepealed statutes of Parliament, and entail the
crown upon those who, under his father’s will, would
follow upon Mary and Elizabeth, the descendants of
Mary Tudor, known to be firm in their attachment
to the reformed faith.</p>

<p>Edward yielded. Given the circumstances, the
power exercised by the Duke over him, his
physical condition, his fears for religion, he could
scarcely have done less. With his own hand he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
drew up the draft of a will which, amended at
Northumberland’s bidding, left the crown in unmistakable
terms to Lady Jane and her heirs
male. It had now to be made law and accepted
by the Council.</p>

<p>On June 11 Sir Edward Montagu, Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, Sir Thomas Bromley,
another Justice of the same court, Sir Richard Baker,
Chancellor of the Augmentations, and the Attorney-
and Solicitor-General were called to Greenwich, and
were introduced into the King’s apartment, Northampton,
Gates, and others being present at the
interview. If what took place on this occasion and
at the other audiences of the legal officers with the
King, as recorded by themselves, is naturally, as
Dr. Lingard has pointed out, represented in such a
manner as to extenuate their conduct in Mary’s eyes,
there seems no reason to doubt that Montagu’s
account is substantially true.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>In his sickness, Edward told them, he had considered
the state of the realm, and of the succession,
should he die without leaving direct heirs;
and, proceeding to point out the danger to religion
and to liberty should his sister Mary succeed to the
throne, he ordered them to “make a book with
speed” of his articles.</p>

<p>The lawyers demurred, but the King, feverishly
eager to put an end to the business, and conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
perhaps that if the thing were not done quickly
it might not be done at all, refused to listen to
the objections they would have urged, dismissing
them with orders to carry out his pleasure with haste.
For all his gentleness and piety, Edward was a Tudor,
and no less peremptory than others of his race.</p>

<p>Two days later&mdash;it was June 14&mdash;having deliberated
on the question, the men of law acquainted
the Council with their decision. The thing could
not be done. To make or execute the “devise”
according to the King’s instructions would be treason.
The report was made to Sir William Petre at Ely
Place; but the Duke of Northumberland was at
hand, and came thereupon into the Council-chamber,
“being in a great rage and fury, trembling
for anger, and, amongst all his ragious talk
called Sir Edward Montagu traitor, and further said
he would fight any man in his shirt in that quarrel.”
It was plain that no technical or legal obstacles were
to be permitted to turn him from his purpose.</p>

<p>The following day the law-officers were again
called to Greenwich. Conveyed in the first place to
a chamber behind the dining-room, they met with a
chilling reception. “All the lords looked upon them
with earnest countenances, as though they had not
known them;” and, brought into the King’s presence,
Edward demanded, “with sharp words and angry
countenance,” why his book was not made?</p>

<p>Montagu, as spokesman for his colleagues, explained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Had the King’s device been executed
it would become void at the King’s death, the
Statute of Succession passed by Parliament
being still in force. A statute could be altered
by statute alone. On Edward’s replying that
Parliament should then shortly be called together,
Montagu caught at the solution. The matter
could be referred to it, and all perils saved. But
this was not the King’s meaning. The deed, he
explained, was to be executed at once, and was to
be afterwards ratified by Parliament. With growing
excitement, he commanded the officers, “very
sharply,” to do his bidding; some of the lords,
standing behind the King, adding that, did they
refuse, they were traitors.</p>

<p>The epithet was freely bandied about in those
days, yet it never failed to carry a menace; and
Montagu, in as “great fear as ever he was in all his
life before, seeing the King so earnest and sharp,
and the Duke so angry the day before,” and being
an “old weak man and without comfort,” began to
look about for a method of satisfying King and
Council without endangering his personal safety. In
the end he gave way, consenting to prepare the
required papers, on condition that he might first
be given a commission under the great seal to draw
up the instrument, and likewise a pardon for having
done so. Northumberland had won the day.</p>

<p>It was afterwards reported that when the will was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
signed a great tempest arose, with a whirlwind such
as had never been seen, the sky dark and fearful,
lightning and infinite thunder; one of the thunderbolts
accompanying that terrible storm falling upon
the miserable church where heresy was first
begotten.... “This accident was observed by
many persons of sense and prudence, and was considered
a great sign of the avenging justice of God.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>The Council, undeterred by the manifestations of
divine wrath, were not backward in endorsing the
deed. Overborne by the Duke, probably also influenced
by the apprehension of a compulsory
restoration of Church spoils should Mary succeed,
they unanimously acquiesced in the act of injustice.
To a second paper, designed by the Duke to commit
his colleagues further, twenty-four councillors and
legal advisers set their hands. By June 21 the
official instrument had received the signatures of
the Lords of the Council, other peers, judges, and
officers of the Crown, to the number of 101. The
Princesses had been set aside, and the fatal heritage,
so far as it was possible, secured to Lady Jane. The
King, at the direction of her nearest of kin, had in
effect affixed his signature to her death-sentence.</p>

<p>When Northumberland was assured of success
he gave a magnificent musical entertainment, to
which the French ambassador was bidden. Three
days earlier it had been reported to Noailles that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Edward was at the point of death, and he was
surprised at the merry-making and the good spirits
prevalent. The affair, it was explained to him, was
in honour of the convalescence of the King, who had
been without fever for two days, and whose recovery
appeared certain.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The envoy doubtless expressed
no incredulity, and congratulated the company upon
the good tidings. He knew that Edward was
moribund, and understood that the rejoicings were
in truth to celebrate the approaching elevation to the
throne of Northumberland’s daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Was she present? We cannot tell; but it was the
Duke’s policy to make her a prominent figure, and
Noailles’ description of her beauty and goodness
implies a personal acquaintance.</p>

<p>It only remained for Edward to die. All those
around him, with perhaps some few exceptions
amongst his personal attendants, were eagerly
awaiting the end. All had been accomplished that
was possible whilst he was yet alive, and Northumberland
and his friends were probably impatient
to be up and doing. His sisters were at a distance,
his uncles dead, Barnaby Fitzpatrick was abroad, and
he was practically alone with the men who had made
him their tool. The last scene is full of pathos.
Three hours before the end, lying with his eyes
shut, he was heard praying for the country which
had been his charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
“‘O God,’ he entreated, ‘deliver me out of this
miserable and wretched life, and take me among Thy

Lord, I commend my spirit to Thee. O Lord,
Thou knowest how happy it were for me to be with
Thee. Yet, for Thy chosen’s sake, send me life and
health, that I may truly serve Thee. O my Lord
God, bless Thy people and save Thine inheritance.
O Lord God, save Thy chosen people of England.
O Lord God, defend this realm from Papistry and
maintain Thy true religion, that I and my people may
praise Thy holy Name, for Jesus Christ His sake.’</p>

<p>“Then turned he his face, and seeing who was
by him, said to them:</p>

<p>“‘Are ye so nigh? I thought ye had been further
off.’</p>

<p>“Then Doctor Owen said:</p>

<p>“‘We heard you speak to yourself, but what you

<p>“He then (after his fashion, smilingly) said, ‘I

<p>The end was near.</p>

<p>“I am faint,” he said. “Lord, have mercy upon
me, and take my spirit”; and so on July 7, towards

<span class="subhead">1553</span>

<span class="subhead">After King Edward’s death&mdash;Results to Lady Jane Grey&mdash;Northumberland’s
schemes&mdash;Mary’s escape&mdash;Scene at Sion
House&mdash;Lady Jane brought to the Tower&mdash;Quarrel with her
husband&mdash;Her proclamation as Queen.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">A boy</span> was dead. A frail little life, long failing,
had gone out. That was all. Nevertheless
upon it had hung the destinies of England.</p>

<p>Speculations and forecasts as to the consequences
had Edward lived are unprofitable. Yet one
wonders what, grown to manhood, he would have
become&mdash;whether the gentle lad, pious, studious,
religious, the modern Josiah, as he was often called,
would have developed, as he grew to maturity,
the dangerous characteristics of his Tudor race, the
fierceness and violence of his father, the melancholy
and relentless fanaticism of Mary, the absence of
principle and sensuality of Elizabeth. Or would he
have fulfilled the many hopes which had found their
centre in him and have justified the love of his
subjects, given him upon credit?</p>

<p>It is impossible to say. What was certain was
that his part was played out, and that others were to
take his place. Amongst these his little cousin Jane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
was at once the most innocent and the most unfortunate.</p>

<p>Hitherto she had looked on as a spectator at life.
Her skiff moored in a creek of the great river, she
had watched from a place of comparative calm the
stream as it rushed by. Here and there a wave
might make itself felt even in that quiet place;
a wreck might be carried past, or she might catch
the drowning cry of a swimmer as he sank. But to
the young such things are accidents from participation
in which they tacitly consider themselves
exempted, regarding them with the fearlessness due
to inexperience. Suddenly all was to be changed.
Torn from her anchorage, she was to be violently
borne along by the torrent towards the inevitable
catastrophe.</p>

<p>As yet she was ignorant of the destiny prepared
for her. Under her father’s roof, she had
pursued her customary occupations, and by some
authorities her third extant letter to Bullinger&mdash;another
tribute of admiration and flattery, and containing
no allusion to current events&mdash;is believed to
belong to the interval occurring between her marriage
and the King’s death. The allusion to herself
as an “untaught virgin,” and the signature “Jane
Grey,” seem to give it a date earlier in the year.
The time was fast approaching when leisure for
literary exercises of the kind would be lacking.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to trace her movements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
precisely at this juncture were it not that she
has left a record of them in a document&mdash;either
directly addressed to Mary from her prison or intended
for her eyes&mdash;in which she demonstrated her
innocence.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Notwithstanding the promise made by
the Duchess of Northumberland at her marriage that
she should be permitted to remain at home, she appears
to have been by this time living with her husband’s
parents, and, upon Edward’s death becoming imminent,
she was informed of the fact by her father-in-law,
who forbade her to leave his house; adding
the startling announcement that, when it should
please God to call the King to His mercy, she would
at once repair to the Tower, her cousin having
nominated her heir to the throne.</p>

<p>The news found her totally unprepared; and,
shocked and partly incredulous, she refused obedience
to the Duke’s commands, continuing to visit
her mother daily, in spite of the indignation of the
Duchess of Northumberland, who “grew wroth
with me and with her, saying that she was determined
to keep me in her house; that she would likewise
keep my husband there, to whom I should go later
in any case, and that she would be under small
obligation to me. Therefore it did not seem to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
lawful to disobey her, and for three or four days
I stayed in her house, until I obtained permission to
resort to the Duke of Northumberland’s palace
at Chelsea.” At this place&mdash;the reason of her
preference for it is not given&mdash;she continued, sick
and anxious, until a summons reached her to go to
Sion House, there to receive a message from the
King. It was Lady Sydney, a married daughter of
the Duke’s, who brought the order, saying, “with
more gravity than usual,” that it was necessary
that her sister-in-law should obey it; and Lady Jane
did not refuse to do so.</p>

<p>Sion House, where the opening scene of the
drama took place, was another of the possessions of
the Duke of Somerset, passed into the hands of
his rival. A monastery, founded by Henry V. at
Isleworth, it had been seized, with other Church
property, in 1539, and had served two years later
as prison to the unhappy child, Katherine Howard.
The place had been acquired by Somerset in the
days of his power, when the building of the great
house, which was to replace the convent, was begun.
The gardens were enclosed by high walls, a triangular
terrace in one of their angles alone allowing the
inmates to obtain a view of the country beyond.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
In 1552 it had, with most of the late Protector’s
goods and chattels, been confiscated, and during the
following year, the year of the King’s death, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
been granted to Northumberland. It was to this
place that Lady Jane was taken to receive the
message said to be awaiting her from the King.</p>

<p>Her destination reached, Sion House was found
empty; but it was not long before those who
were pulling the strings arrived. The message from
the King had been a fiction. Edward’s gentle
spirit was at rest, and he himself forgotten in the
rush of events. There was little time for thought
of the dead. The interests of religion and of the
State, as some would call it, the ambition of unscrupulous
and unprincipled men, as it would be
named by others, demanded the whole attention of
the steersmen who stood, for the moment, at the helm.</p>

<p>It had been decided to keep the fact of the King’s
death secret until measures should have been taken
to ensure the success of the desperate game they
were playing. To secure possession of the person
of his natural successor was of the first importance;
and a letter had been despatched to Mary when her
brother was manifestly at the point of death which
it was hoped would avail to bring her to London and
would enable her enemies to fulfil their purpose.
Stating that the King was very ill, she was entreated
to come to him, as he earnestly desired the comfort
of her presence.</p>

<p>Mary must have been well aware of the risk she
would run in responding to the appeal; and it says
much for her courage and her affection that she did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
not hesitate to incur it. A fortunate chance, however,
frustrated the designs against her. Starting from
Hunsdon, where the tidings had found her, she
had reached Hoddesden on her way to Greenwich,
when she was met by intelligence that determined
her to go no further. The King was dead; nor
was it difficult to discern in the urgent summons,
sent too late to accomplish its ostensible purpose,
a transparent attempt to induce her to place herself
in the power of her enemies.</p>

<p>Opinions have differed as to the means by which
Northumberland’s scheme was frustrated. Some say
that the news was conveyed to the Princess by the
Earl of Arundel. Sir Nicholas Throckmorton also
claims credit for the warning. According to this
account of the matter, a young brother of his, in
attendance upon Northumberland, had become cognisant
of the intended treachery, and had come
post-haste to report what was a-foot at his father’s
house. A few words spoken by Sir John Gates,
visiting the Duke before he had risen, were all
that had reached the young man’s ears, but those
words had been of startling significance, the state
of affairs being what it was.</p>

<p>“What, sir,” he had heard Gates say, “will you let
the Lady Mary escape, and not secure her person?”</p>

<p>A consultation was hurriedly held at Throckmorton
House, between the father and his three sons. Sir
Nicholas, who had been present at the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
death, was too well aware of the circumstances to
minimise the importance of his brother’s story, and,
summoning the Princess Mary’s goldsmith, it was
decided to entrust him with the duty of conveying a
caution to his mistress, and stopping her journey.
Sir Nicholas’s metrical version of what followed
may be given.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p class="in0">The first stroke hazarded by the conspirators had
resulted in failure. Mary, after some deliberation,
turned her face northwards, and escaped the snare
laid for her by her enemies.</p>

<p>The next object of Northumberland and his friends
was to obtain the concurrence of the City to the
substitution of his daughter-in-law for the rightful
heir. Various as were the views of the best means
of ensuring success, all the Council were agreed
on one point, namely, “that London was the hand
which must reach Jane the crown.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> London was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
be made to do it. On July 8 the Lord Mayor, with
six aldermen, six “merchants of the staple, and as
many merchant adventurers,” were summoned to
Greenwich, were there secretly informed of the King’s
death, and of his will by letters patent, “to which
they were sworn and charged to keep it secret.”</p>

<p>All this had been done before Lady Jane was
summoned to Sion House. It was time for the
stage Queen to make her appearance, and at Sion
the facts were made known to her.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>Of her reception of the great news accounts vary.
A graphic picture, painted in the first place by
Heylyn, has been copied by divers other historians.
The learned John Nichols, unable to trace it in
any contemporary documents or records, has decided
that it must be classed amongst “those dramatic
scenes in which historical writers formerly considered
themselves justified in indulging.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>He is probably right; yet an early and generally
accepted tradition has a value of its own, and may
be true to the spirit, if not to the letter, of what
actually occurred. Mary herself afterwards told the
envoy of Charles V. that she believed her cousin
to have had no part in the Duke of Northumberland’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
enterprise; and, supposing her to have been
ignorant, or only dimly cognisant, of the plot, the
revelation of it may easily have occasioned her a
shock. It has been constantly asserted that, in this
first interview with those who, calling themselves her
subjects, were practically the masters of her fate,
she began by declining to be a party to their scheme;
and if her letter, written at a later date, from the
Tower to Mary, does not wholly confirm the assertion,
it points to an attitude of reluctant assent.
Her mother-in-law had given her hints of what was
intended, but, like the announcement made by
the Duke at Durham House of her approaching
greatness, they were too incredible to be taken
seriously; and the fact that when she was joined
at Sion by the Dukes of Northumberland and
Suffolk they did not at once make the matter
plain, but confined the conversation for a time to
indifferent subjects, seems to indicate a doubt upon
their part of her pliability. There was, nevertheless,
a change in their demeanour and bearing
giving rise in her mind to an uneasy consciousness
of a mystery she had not fathomed; whilst
Huntingdon and Pembroke, who were present,
treated her with even more incomprehensible
reverence, and went so far as to bow the knee.</p>

<p>On the arrival of her mother, together with the
Duchess of Northumberland, the explanation of the
riddle took place. The tidings of the King’s death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
and of her exaltation was broken to her, together
with the reasons prompting Edward to set aside his
sisters in her favour. The nobles fell upon their
knees, took her formally for their Queen, and
swore&mdash;it was shortly to be proved how little the
oath was worth&mdash;to shed their blood in defence of
her rights.</p>

<p>“Having heard which things,” pursues Lady Jane
in her apology, “with infinite grief of spirit, I call
to witness those lords who were present that I was
so stunned and stupefied that, overcome by sudden
and unexpected sorrow, they saw me fall to the
ground, weeping very bitterly. And afterwards,
declaring to them my insufficiency, I lamented much
the death of so noble a prince; and at the same
time turned to God, humbly praying and beseeching
Him that, if what was given me was in truth and
legitimately mine, He would grant me grace and
power to govern to His glory and service, and for
the good of this realm.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>There is, as Dr. Lingard points out, nothing unnatural
in this description of what had occurred;
whereas the grandiloquent language attributed to
her by some historians is most unlikely to have
been used at a moment both of grief and
excitement. According to these authorities, not
only did she defend Mary’s right, and denounce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
those who had conspired against it, but delivered
a lengthy oration upon the fickleness of fortune.
“If she enrich any, it is but to make them the
subject of her sport; if she raise others, it is but
to pleasure herself with their ruins. What she
adored yesterday, to-day is her pastime. And if
I now permit her to adorn and crown me, I must
to-morrow suffer her to crush and tear me to
pieces”&mdash;proceeding to cite Katherine of Aragon
and Anne Boleyn as examples of those who had,
to their own undoing, worn a crown. “If you love
me sincerely and in good earnest,” she is made to say,
“you will rather wish me a secure and quiet fortune,
though mean, than an exalted condition exposed
to the wind, and followed by some dismal fall.”</p>

<p>Poor little plaything of the fortune she is represented
as anathematising, the designs of those who
were striving to exalt her were due to nothing
less than a sincere love. Any other puppet
would have answered their purpose equally well,
so that the excuse of royal blood was in her veins.
But Jane, willing or unwilling, was to be made use
of for their ends, and it was vain for her to protest.</p>

<p>On the following day, July 10, the Queen-designate
was brought, following the ancient custom
of Kings on their accession, to the Tower; reaching
it at three o’clock, to be received at the gate by
Northumberland, and formally presented with the
keys in the presence of a great crowd who looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
on at the proceedings in sinister silence and gave
no sign of rejoicing or cordiality.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the Marquis of Winchester, in his
capacity of Treasurer, brought the crown jewels,
with the crown itself, “asking me,” wrote Jane,
“to put it on my head, to try whether it fitted me
or not. Who knows well that, with many excuses,
I refused. He not the less insisted that I should
boldly take it, and that another should be made
that my husband might be crowned with me, which
I certainly heard unwillingly, and with infinite grief
and displeasure.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>The idea that young Guilford Dudley, with
no royal blood to make his claim colourable, was
intended to share her dignity appears to have
roused his wife, somewhat strangely, to hot indignation.
She at least was a Tudor on her mother’s
side; but what was Dudley, that he should aspire so
high? Had she loved her boy-husband she might
have taken a different view of his pretensions; but
there is nothing to show that she regarded him with
any special affection, and she was disposed to use
her authority after a fashion neither he nor his
father would tolerate.</p>

<p>At first Guilford, taken by surprise, appeared
inclined to yield the point, and in a conversation
between the two, when Winchester had withdrawn,
he agreed that, were he to be made King, it should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
be only by Act of Parliament. Thereupon, losing
no time in setting the matter on a right footing,
Jane sent for the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke,
and informed them that, if she were to be Queen,
she would be willing to make her husband Duke;
“but to make him King I would not consent.”</p>

<p>Though Arundel and Pembroke were probably
quite at one with her on the question, that she should
show signs of exercising an independent judgment
was naturally exasperating to those to whom it was
due that she was placed in her present position; and
when the Duchess of Northumberland became
aware of what was going forward she not only
treated Lady Jane, according to her own account,
very ill, but stirred up Guilford to do the like; the
boy, primed by his mother, declaring that he would
in no wise be Duke, but King, and, holding sulkily
aloof from his wife that night, so that she was
compelled, “as a woman, and loving my husband,”
to send the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke to bring
him to her, otherwise he would have left in the
morning, at his mother’s bidding, for Sion. “Thus,”
ends the poor child, “I was in truth deceived by the
Duke and Council, and badly treated by my husband
and his mother.”</p>

<p>The discussion was premature. Boy and girl
were all too soon to learn that it was not to be a
question of crowns for either so much as of heads to
wear them. Whilst the wrangle had been carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
on in the Tower, the first step had been taken
towards bringing the disputants to the scaffold.
The death of the King had been made public,
together with the provisions of his will, and Jane
had been proclaimed Queen in two or three parts of
the City.</p>

<p>“The tenth day of the same month,” runs the
entry in the <cite>Grey Friar’s Chronicle</cite>, “after seven
o’clock at night, was made a proclamation in Cheap
by three heralds and one trumpet ... for Jane,
the Duke of Suffolk’s daughter, to be Queen of
England. But few or none said ‘God save her.’”</p>

<p>There was a singular unanimity upon the subject
amongst the citizens of London. It is said that
upon the faces of the heralds forced to proclaim
the new Queen their discontent was visible;<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and
a curious French letter sent from London at the
time states, after mentioning the absence of any
acclamation upon the part of the people, that a
moment afterwards they had broken out into
lamentation, clamour, tears, sighs, sadness, and
desolation impossible to describe.</p>

<p>Thus inauspiciously was Lady Jane’s nine days’
reign inaugurated. On a great catafalque in Westminster
Abbey the dead boy-King was lying,
guarded day and night by twelve watchers until
he should be given sepulture. But there was little
leisure to attend to his obsequies on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the men who had made him their tool, and had
staked their lives and fortunes upon the success of
their plot. For the present all had gone according
to their hopes. “Through the pious intents of
Edward, the religion of Mary, the ambition of
Northumberland, the simplicity of Suffolk, the
fearfulness of the judges, and the flattery of the
courtiers”&mdash;thus Fuller sums up the causes to
which the situation was due&mdash;“matters were made
as sure as man’s policy can make that good which
in itself is bad.” It was quickly to be seen to what
that security amounted.</p>

<span class="subhead">Lady Jane as Queen&mdash;Mary asserts her claims&mdash;The English
envoys at Brussels&mdash;Mary’s popularity&mdash;Northumberland leaves
London&mdash;His farewells.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> enter in any degree into the position of
“Jane the Queen” during the brief period
when she was the nominal head of the State, the time
in which she lived, as well as the prevalent conception
of royalty in England, must be taken into the
reckoning.</p>

<p>In our own days she would not only have been a
mere cipher&mdash;as indeed she was&mdash;but would have
been content to remain such, so far as actual power
was concerned. Royalty, stripped of its reality,
is largely become a mere matter of show, a part
of the pageant of State. In the case of a child
of sixteen it would wear that character alone. But
in the days of the Tudors a King was accustomed
to govern; even in the hands of a minor a sceptre
was not a mere symbolic ornament.</p>

<p>And Lady Jane was precisely the person to
take a serious view of her duties. Thoughtful,
conscientious, and grave beyond her years, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
had no sooner found herself a Queen than she had
asserted her authority in opposition to that of the
man who had invested her with the dignity by
announcing her intention of refusing to allow it
to be shared by his son&mdash;already, it appears by
letters from Brussels, recognised there as Prince
Consort&mdash;and shut up in the gloomy fortress to
which she had been taken she was occupied
with the thought of her duty to the kingdom she
believed herself to be called to rule over, of the
necessity of providing for the wants of the nation,
and more especially for the future of religion.
Whilst, perhaps, all the time there lingered in her
mind a misgiving, lifting its head to confront her
from time to time with a paralysing doubt, torturing
to a sensitive and scrupulous nature; was she indeed
the rightful Queen of England?</p>

<p>Mary had lost no time in asserting her claims.
On July 9&mdash;the day before that of Jane’s proclamation&mdash;she
had written a letter to the Council from
Kenninghall in Norfolk, expressing her astonishment
that they had neither communicated to her the fact
of her brother’s death, nor had caused her to be
proclaimed Queen, and requiring them to perform
this last duty without delay. The rebuke reaching
London on the morning of January 11 “seemed to
give their Lordships no other trouble than the
returning of an answer,”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> which they did in terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
of studied insult, reminding her of her alleged
illegitimacy, and exhorting her to submit to her
lawful sovereign, Queen Jane, else she should prove
grievous unto them and unto herself. This unconciliatory
document received the signature of every
one of the Council, including Cecil, who was
afterwards at much pains to explain his concurrence
in the proceedings of his colleagues; and
Northumberland, as he despatched it, must have
felt with satisfaction that it would be difficult for
those responsible for the missive to make their
peace with the woman to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p>The terms in which the defiance was couched show
the little importance attached to the chances that
Henry VIII.’s eldest daughter would ever be in
a position to vindicate her rights. Once again
her enemies had failed to take into account the
stubborn justice of the people. Though by many
of them Mary’s religion was feared and disliked,
they viewed with sullen disapproval the conspiracy
to rob her of her heritage. And Northumberland
they hated.</p>

<p>The sinister rumours current during the last few
years were still afloat; justified, as it seemed, by the
course of recent events. It was said that the Duke
had incited Somerset to put his brother to death, and
had then slain Somerset, in order that, bereft
of his nearest of kin, the young King might the
more easily become his victim. The reports of foul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
play were repeated, and it was said that Edward
had been removed by poison to make way for
Northumberland’s daughter-in-law. That he had
not come by his death by fair means was indeed
so generally believed that the Emperor, writing to
Mary when she had defeated her enemies, counselled
her to punish all those that had been concerned
in it.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>The charge of poisoning was not so uncommon
as to make it strange that it should be thought to
have been instrumental in removing an obstacle from
the path of an ambitious man. In Lady Jane’s
pitiful letter to her cousin she stated&mdash;doubtless in
good faith&mdash;that poison had twice been administered
to her, once in the house of the Duchess of Northumberland&mdash;when
the motive would have been hard
to find&mdash;and again in the Tower, “as I have certain
evidence.” What the poor child honestly believed
had been attempted in her case, the angry people
imagined had been successfully accomplished in
the case of their young King, and his death was
another item laid to the charge of the man they
hated.</p>

<p>The news of what was going forward in England
had by this time become known abroad. Though
letters had been addressed by the Council to Sir
Philip Hoby and Sir Richard Morysine, ambassadors
at Brussels, announcing the King’s death and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
cousin’s accession, the tidings had reached them
unofficially before the arrival of the despatches from
London. As the envoys were walking in the garden,
they were joined by a servant of the Emperor’s,
Don Diego by name, who, making profession of
personal good will towards their country, expressed
his regret at its present loss, adding at the same
time his congratulations that so noble a King&mdash;meaning,
it would seem, Guilford Dudley&mdash;had been
provided for them, a King he would himself be at
all times ready to serve.</p>

<p>The envoys replied that the sorrowful news had
reached them, but not the joyous&mdash;that they were
glad to hear so much from him. Don Diego thereupon
proceeded to impart the further fact of Edward’s
will in favour of Lady Jane. With the question
whether the two daughters of Henry VIII. were
bastards or not, strangers, he observed, had nothing
to do. It was reasonable to accept as King him who
had been declared such by the nobles of the land;
and Diego, for his part, was bound to rejoice that
His Majesty had been set in this office, since he was
his godfather, and&mdash;so long as the Emperor was
in amity with him&mdash;would be willing to shed his
blood in his service.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>This last personal detail probably contained the
explanation of Don Diego’s approbation of an
arrangement which could scarcely be expected to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
commend itself to his master, and likewise of the
curiously subordinate part awarded to Lady Jane
in his account of it. But whatever might be the
opinion of foreigners, it had quickly been made
plain in England that the country would not be
content to accept either the sovereignty of Jane or
of her husband without a struggle.</p>

<p>Of the temper of the capital a letter or libel
scattered abroad, after the fashion of the day,
during the week, is an example. In this document,
addressed by a certain “poor Pratte” to a
young man who had been placed in the pillory and
had lost his ears in consequence of his advocacy of
Mary’s rights, love for the lawful Queen, and hatred
of the “ragged bear,” Northumberland, is expressed
in every line. Should England prove disloyal, misfortune
will overtake it as a chastisement for its
sin; the Gospel will be plucked away and the Lady
Mary replaced by so cruel a Pharaoh as the ragged
bear. Her Grace&mdash;in marked contrast to the sentiments
commonly attributed to the Duke&mdash;is doubtless
more sorrowful for her brother than glad to
be Queen, and would have been as glad of his life
as the ragged bear of his death. In conclusion, the
writer trusts that God will shortly exalt Mary,
“and pluck down that Jane&mdash;I cannot nominate her
Queen, for that I know no other Queen but the
good Lady Mary, her Grace, whom God prosper.”
To those who would Mary to be Queen poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Pratte wishes long life and pleasure; to her
opponents, the pains of Satan in hell.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Such was the delirious spirit of loyalty towards
the dispossessed heir, even amongst those who owed
no allegiance to Rome. It was not long before the
Council were to be taught by more forcible means
than scurrilous abuse to correct their estimate of the
situation and of the forces at work, strangely
misapprehended at the first by one and all.</p>

<p>News was reaching London of the support tendered
to Mary. The Earls of Sussex and of Bath had
declared in her favour; the county of Suffolk had
led the way in rising on her behalf; nobles and
gentlemen, with their retainers, were flocking to
her standard; it was becoming clearer with every
hour that she would not consent to be ousted from
her rights without a fierce struggle.</p>

<p>Measures for meeting the resistance of her adherents
had to be taken without delay; and
Northumberland, wisely unwilling to absent himself
from the capital at a juncture so critical, had intended
to depute Suffolk to command the forces to be led
against her; to gain, if possible, possession of her
person, and to bring her to London. This was
the arrangement hastily made on July 12. Before
nightfall it had been cancelled at the entreaty of
the titular Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
It is not difficult to enter into the Lady Jane’s
feelings, threatened with the absence of her father
on a dangerous errand. With her nervous fears
of poison, her evident dislike of her mother-in-law,
and ill at ease in new circumstances and surroundings,
she may well have clung to the comfort and
support afforded by his presence; nor is it incomprehensible
that she had “taken the matter heavily”
when informed of the decision of the Council.
Her wishes might have had little effect if other
causes had not conspired to assist her to gain her
object, and it has been suggested that those of the
lords already contemplating the possibility of Mary’s
success, and desirous of being freed from the restraint
imposed by Northumberland’s presence amongst them,
may have had a hand in instigating her request,
proffered with tears, that her father might tarry at
home in her company. The entreaty was, at all
events, in full accordance with their desires, and
pressure was brought upon Northumberland to induce
him to yield to her petition&mdash;leaving Suffolk
in his place at the Tower, and himself leading the
troops north.</p>

<p>Many reasons were urged rendering it advisable
that the Duke should take the field in person. He
had been the victor in the struggle with Kett,
of which Norfolk had been the scene, and enjoyed,
in consequence, a great reputation in that county,
where it seemed that the fight with Mary and her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
adherents was to take place. He was, moreover,
an able soldier; Suffolk was not. On the other
hand, it was impossible for Northumberland to adduce
the true motives prompting his desire to continue at
headquarters; since chief amongst them was the
wisdom and prudence of remaining at hand to maintain
his personal influence over his colleagues and to
keep them true to the oaths they had sworn. In
the end he consented to bow to their wishes.</p>

<p>“Since ye think it good,” he said, “I and mine
will go, not doubting of your fidelity to the
Queen’s Majesty, which I leave in your custody.”</p>

<p>More than the Queen’s Majesty was left to their
care. The safety, if not the life, of the man chiefly
responsible for the conspiracy which had made her
what she was, hung upon their loyalty to their vows,
and Northumberland must have known it. But
Lady Jane was to have her way, and the Council,
waiting upon her, brought the welcome news to
the Queen, who humbly thanked the Duke for
reserving her father at home, and besought him&mdash;she
was already learning royal fashions&mdash;to use his
diligence. To this Northumberland, surely not
without an inward smile, answered that he would
do what in him lay, and the matter was concluded.</p>

<p>At Durham House, next day, the Duke’s retinue
assembled.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> In the forenoon he met the Council,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
taking leave of them in friendly sort, yet with words
betraying his misgivings in the very terms used
to convey the assurance of his confidence in their
good faith and fidelity.</p>

<p>He and the other nobles who were to be his companions
went forth, he told the men left behind, as
much to assure their safety as that of the Queen
herself. Whilst he and his comrades were to risk
their lives in the field, their preservation at home,
with the preservation of their children and families,
was committed to those who stayed in London.
And then he spoke some weighty words, the doubts
and forebodings within him finding vent:</p>

<p>“If we thought ye would through malice, conspiracy,
or dissension, leave us your friends in the
briars and betray us, we could as well sundry ways
forsee and provide for our own safeguards as any of
you, by betraying us, can do for yours. But now,
upon the only trust and faithfulness of your honours,
whereof we think ourselves most assured, we do
hazard and jubarde [jeopardize] our lives, which trust
and promise if ye shall violate, hoping thereby of life
and promotion, yet shall not God count you
innocent of our bloods, neither acquit you of the
sacred and holy oath of allegiance made freely by
you to this virtuous lady, the Queen’s Highness,
who by your and our enticement is rather of force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
placed therein than by her own seeking and request.”
Commending to their consideration the interests
of religion, he again reiterated his warning. “If
ye mean deceit, though not forthwith, yet hereafter,
God will revenge the same,” ending by assuring his
colleagues that his words had not been caused by
distrust, but that he had spoken them as a reminder
of the chances of variance which might grow in his
absence.</p>

<p>One of the Council&mdash;the narrator does not give
his name&mdash;took upon him to reply for the rest.</p>

<p>“My Lord,” he answered, “if ye mistrust any of
us in this matter your Grace is far deceived. For
which of us can wipe his hands clean thereof? And
if we should shrink from you as one that is culpable,
which of us can excuse himself as guiltless?
Therefore herein your doubt is too far cast.”</p>

<p>It was characteristic of times and men that, far
from resenting the suspicion of unfaith, the sole
ground upon which the Duke was asked to base a
confidence in the fidelity of his colleagues was that
it would not be to their interest to betray him.</p>

<p>“I pray God it may be so,” he answered. “Let
us go to dinner.”</p>

<p>After dinner came an interview with Jane,
who bade farewell to the Duke and to the lords
who were to accompany him on his mission. Everywhere
we are confronted by the same heavy atmosphere
of impending treachery. As the chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
conspirator passed through the Council-chamber
Arundel met him&mdash;Arundel, who was to be one
of the first to leave the sinking ship, and who may
already have been looking for a loophole of escape
from a perilous situation. Yet he now prayed God
be with his Grace, saying he was very sorry it was
not his chance to go with him and bear him company,
in whose presence he could find it in his heart
to shed his blood, even at his foot.</p>

<p>The words, with their gratuitous and unsolicited
asseveration of loyal friendship, must have been
remembered by both when the two met again. It
is nevertheless possible that, moved and affected, the
Earl was sincere at the moment in his protestations.</p>

<p>“Farewell, gentle Thomas,” he added to the
Duke’s “boy,” Thomas Lovell, taking him by the
hand, “Farewell, gentle Thomas, with all my
heart.”</p>

<p>The next day Northumberland took his departure
from the capital. As he rode through the city, with
some six hundred followers, the same ominous
silence that had greeted the proclamation of Lady
Jane was preserved by the throng gathered together
to see her father-in-law pass. The Duke noticed it.</p>

<p>“The people press to see us,” he observed
gloomily, “but not one sayeth God speed us.”</p>

<p>When next Northumberland and the London
crowd were face to face it was under changed circumstances.</p>

deposition&mdash;She returns to Sion House.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Northumberland</span> was gone. The weight
of his dominant influence was removed, and
many of his colleagues must have breathed more
freely. In the Tower Lady Jane, with those of the
Council left in London, continued to watch and
wait the course of events. It must have been
recognised that the future was dark and uncertain;
and whilst the lords and nobles looked about for
a way of escape should affairs go ill with the new
government, the boy and girl arbitrarily linked
together may have been drawn closer by the
growing sense of a common danger. Guilford
Dudley did not share his father’s unpopularity.
Young and handsome, he is said to have been
endowed with virtues calling forth an unusual
amount of pity for his premature end,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> and Heylyn
declared that of all Dudley’s brood he had nothing
of his father in him.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> “He was,” says Fuller, adding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
his testimony, “a goodly and (for aught I find to the
contrary) a godly gentleman, whose worst fault was
that he was son to an ambitious father.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> The
flash of boyish ambition he had evinced in his
determination to be content with nothing less than
kingship must have been soon extinguished by the
consciousness that life itself was at stake.</p>

<p>For quicker and quicker came tidings of fresh
triumphs for Mary, each one striking at the hopes
of her rival’s partisans. News was brought that Mary
had been proclaimed Queen first in Buckinghamshire;
next at Norwich. Her forces were gathering
strength, her adherents gaining courage. Again, six
vessels placed at Yarmouth to intercept her flight,
should she attempt it, were won over to her side,
their captains, with men and ordnance, making
submission; whereat “the Lady Mary”&mdash;from whose
mind nothing had been further than flight&mdash;“and
her company were wonderful joyous.”</p>

<p>This last blow hit the party acknowledging Jane
as Queen hard; nor were its effects long in becoming
visible. In the Tower “each man began to pluck in
his horns,” and to cast about for a manner of dissevering
his private fortunes from a cause manifestly
doomed to disaster. Pembroke, who in May had
associated himself with Northumberland by marrying
his son to Katherine Grey, was one of the foremost
in considering the possibility of quitting the Tower, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
that he might hold consultation with those without;
but as yet he had not devised a means of accomplishing
his purpose. Each day brought its developments
within the walls of the fortress, and beyond them.
On the Sunday night&mdash;not a week after the crown
had been fitted on Jane’s head&mdash;when the Lord
Treasurer, then officiously desirous of adding a
second for her husband, was leaving the building
in order to repair to his own house, the gates were
suddenly shut and the keys carried up to the mistress
of the Tower. What was the reason? No one
knew, but it was whispered that a seal had been
found missing. Others said that she had feared
some packinge [<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic</i>] in the Treasurer. The days
were coming when it would be in no one’s power
to keep the Lords of the Council at their post
under lock and key.</p>

<p>That Sunday morning&mdash;it was July 16&mdash;Ridley
had preached at Paul’s Cross before the Mayor,
Aldermen, and people, pleading Lady Jane’s cause
with all the eloquence at his command. Let his
hearers, he said, contrast her piety and gentleness
with the haughtiness and papistry of her rival. And
he told the story of his visit to Hunsdon, of his
attempt to convince Mary of her errors, and of its
failure, conjuring all who heard him to maintain
the cause of Queen Jane and of the Gospel. But
his exhortations fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>And still one messenger of ill tidings followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
hard upon the heels of another. Cecil, with his
natural aptitude for intrigue, was engaging in
secret deliberations with members of the Council
inclined to be favourable to Mary, finding in
especial the Lord Treasurer, Winchester, the Earl
of Arundel, and Lord Darcy, willing listeners,
“whereof I did immediately tell Mr. Petre”&mdash;the
other Secretary&mdash;“for both our comfort.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
Presently a pretext was invented to cover the escape
of the lords from the Tower. It was said that
Northumberland had sent for auxiliaries, and that
it was necessary to hold a consultation with the
foreign ambassadors as to the employment of
mercenaries.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> The meeting was to take place at
Baynard’s Castle, Arundel observing significantly
that he liked not the air of the Tower. He and
his friends may indeed have reflected that it had
proved fatal to many less steeped in treason than
they. To Baynard’s Castle some of the lords
accordingly repaired, sending afterwards to summon
the rest to join them, with the exception of Suffolk,
who remained behind, in apparent ignorance of what
was going forward.</p>

<p>In the consultation, held on July 19, the deathblow
was dealt to the hopes of those faithful to the
nine-days’ Queen. Arundel was the first to declare
himself unhesitatingly on Mary’s side, and to denounce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the Duke, from whom he had so lately
parted on terms of devoted friendship. He boasted
of his courage in now opposing Northumberland&mdash;a
man of supreme authority, and&mdash;as one who had
little or no conscience&mdash;fond of blood. It was by
no desire of vengeance that Arundel’s conduct was
prompted, he declared, but by conscience and anxiety
for the public welfare; the Duke was actuated
by a desire neither for the good of the kingdom nor
by religious zeal, but purely by a desire for power,
and he proceeded to hold him up to the reprobation
of his colleagues.</p>

<p>Pembroke made answer, promising, with his hand
on his sword, to make Mary Queen. There were
indeed few dissentient voices, and, though some of
the lords at first maintained that warning should
be sent to Northumberland and a general pardon
obtained from Mary, their proposals did not meet
with favour, and they did not press them.</p>

<p>A hundred men had been despatched on various
pretexts, and by degrees, to the Tower, with orders to
make themselves masters of the place, in case Suffolk
would not leave it except upon compulsion; but the
Duke was not a man to lead a forlorn hope. Had
Northumberland been at hand a struggle might
have taken place; as it was, not a voice was raised
against the decision of the Council, and with almost
incredible rapidity the face of affairs underwent
a change, absolute and complete. Suffolk, so soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
as the determination of the lords was made known
to him, lost no time in expressing his willingness to
concur in it and to add his signature to the proclamation
of Mary, already drawn up.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> He was, he
said, but one man; and proclaiming his daughter’s
rival in person on Tower Hill, he finally struck his
colours; going so far, as some affirm, as to share in
the demonstration in the new Queen’s honour in
Cheapside, where the proclamation was read by the
Earl of Pembroke amidst a scene of wild enthusiasm
contrasting vividly with the coldness and apathy
shown by the populace when, nine days earlier, they
had been asked to accept the Duke of Northumberland’s
daughter-in-law as their Queen.</p>

<p>“For my time I never saw the like,” says a news-letter,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
“and by the report of others the like was
never seen. The number of caps that were thrown
up at the proclamation were not to be told.... I
saw myself money was thrown out at windows for
joy. The bonfires were without number, and, what
with shouting and crying of the people and ringing
of the bells, there could no one hear almost what
another said, besides banquetings and singing in
the street for joy.”</p>

<p>Arundel was there, as well as Pembroke, with
Shrewsbury and others, and the day was ended with
evensong at St. Paul’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
And whilst all this was going on outside, in the
gloom of the Tower, where the air must have struck
chill even on that July day, sat the little victim
of state-craft&mdash;“Cette pauvre reine,” wrote Noailles
to his master, “qui s’en peut dire de la féve”&mdash;a
Twelfth Night’s Queen&mdash;in the fortress that had
seen her brief exaltation, and was so soon to become
to her a prison. As the joy-bells echoed through
the City and the shouting of the people penetrated
the thick walls she must have wondered what
was the cause of rejoicing. Presently she learnt
it.</p>

<p>That afternoon had been fixed for the christening
of a child born to Underhyll&mdash;nicknamed, on account
of his religious zeal, the Hot-Gospeller&mdash;on duty
as a Gentleman Pensioner at the Tower. The baby
was highly favoured, since the Duke of Suffolk and
the Earl of Pembroke were to be his sponsors by
proxy and Lady Jane had signified her intention of
acting as godmother, calling the infant Guilford, after
her husband.</p>

<p>Lady Throckmorton, wife to Sir Nicholas, in
attendance on Jane,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> had been chosen to represent her
mistress at the ceremony; and, on quitting the
Tower for that purpose, had waited on the Queen
and received her usual orders, according to royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
etiquette. Upon her return, the baptism over, she
found all&mdash;like a transformation scene at the
theatre&mdash;changed. The canopy of state had been
removed from Lady Jane’s apartment, and Lady
Jane herself, divested of her sovereignty, was
practically a prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>During the absence of the Lady-in-waiting, Suffolk,
his part on Cheapside played, had returned to the
Tower, to set matters there on their new footing.
Informing his daughter, as one imagines with the
roughness of a man smarting under defeat, that
since her cousin had been elected Queen by the
Council, and had been proclaimed, it was time she
should do her honour, he removed the insignia
of royalty. The rank she had possessed not being
her own she must make a virtue of necessity, and
bow to that fortune of which she had been the sport
and victim.</p>

<p>Rising to the occasion, Jane, as might be expected,
made fitting reply. The words now spoken by her
father were, she answered, more becoming and
praiseworthy than those he had uttered on putting
her in possession of the crown; proceeding to
moralise the matter after a fashion that can only
be attributed to the imaginative faculties of the
narrator of the scene. This done she, more
naturally, withdrew into her private apartments with
her mother and other ladies and gave way, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of her firmness, to “infinite sorrow.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> A further
scene narrated by the Italian, Florio, on the authority
of the Duke of Suffolk’s chaplain&mdash;“as her father’s
learned and pious preacher told me”&mdash;represents
her as confronted with some at least of the men who
had betrayed her, and as reproaching them bitterly
with their duplicity. Without vouching for the
accuracy of the speech reported, touches are discernible
in it&mdash;evidences of a very human wrath,
indignation, and scorn&mdash;unlikely to have been
invented by men whose habit it was to describe
the speaker as the living embodiment of meekness
and patience, and it may be that the evangelist’s
account is founded on fact.</p>

<p>“Therefore, O Lords of the Council,” she is
made to say, “there is found in men of illustrious
blood, and as much esteemed by the world as you,
double dealing, deceit, fickleness, and ruin to the
innocent. Which of you can boast with truth that
I besought him to make me a Queen? Where
are the gifts I promised or gave on this account?
Did ye not of your own accord drag me from my
literary studies, and, depriving me of liberty, place
me in this rank? Alas! double-faced men, how well
I see, though late, to what end ye set me in this
royal dignity! How will ye escape the infamy
following upon such deeds?” How were broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
promises, violated oaths, to be coloured and disguised?
Who would trust them for the future?
“But be of good cheer, with the same measure it
shall be meted to you again.”</p>

<p>With this prophecy of retribution to follow she
ended. “For a good space she was silent; and they
departed, full of shame, leaving her well guarded.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>Her attendants were not long in availing themselves
of the permission accorded them to go where
they pleased. The service of Lady Jane was, from
an honour, become a perilous duty; and they went
to their own homes, leaving their nine-days’ mistress
“burdened with thought and woe.” The following
morning she too quitted the Tower, returning to
Sion House. It was no more than ten days since
she had been brought from it in royal state.</p>

“etait chose plaisante à voir et oir.” The question
all men were asking was what stand would be made
by the leader of the troops arrayed against her.
That Northumberland, knowing that he had sinned
too deeply for forgiveness, would yield without a
blow can scarcely have been contemplated by the
most sanguine of his opponents, and the singular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
transmutation taking place in a man who hitherto,
whatever might have been his faults or crimes, had
never been lacking in courage, must have taken his
enemies and what friends remained to him by surprise.</p>

<p>“Bold, sensitive, and magnanimous,” as some one
describes him,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> he was to display a lack of every
manly quality only explicable on the hypothesis that
the incessant strain and excitement of the last three
weeks had told upon nerves and spirits to an extent
making it impossible for him to meet the crisis with
dignity and valour.</p>

<p>Hampered with orders from the Council framed
in Mary’s interest and with the secret object of
delaying his movements until her adherents had had
time to muster in force, he did not adopt the only
course&mdash;that of immediate attack&mdash;offering a possibility
of success, and had retreated to Cambridge
when the news that Mary had been proclaimed
in London reached him. From that instant he
abandoned the struggle.</p>

<p>On the previous day the Vice-Chancellor of the
University, Doctor Sandys, had preached, at his
request, a sermon directed against Mary. Now,
Duke and churchman standing side by side in the
market-place, Northumberland, with the tears running
down his face, and throwing his cap into the air,
proclaimed her Queen. She was a merciful woman,
he told Sandys, and all would doubtless share in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
general pardon. Sandys knew better, and bade the
Duke not flatter himself with false hopes. Were
the Queen ever so much inclined to pardon, those
who ruled her would destroy Northumberland, whoever
else were spared.</p>

<p>The churchman proved to have judged more
accurately than the soldier. An hour later the Duke
received letters from the Council, indicating the
treatment he might expect at their hands. He was
thereby bidden, on pain of treason, to disarm, and
it was added that, should he come within ten miles
of London, his late comrades would fight him.
Could greater loyalty and zeal in the service of the
rising sun be displayed?</p>

<p>Fidelity was at a discount. His troops melted
away, leaving their captain at the mercy of his
enemies. In the camp confusion prevailed.
Northumberland was first put under arrest, then set
again at liberty upon his protest, based upon the
orders of the Council that “all men should go his
way.” Was he, the leader, to be prevented from
acting upon their command? Young Warwick, his
son, was upon the point of riding away, when, the
morning after the scene in the market-place, the
Earl of Arundel arrived from Queen Mary with
orders to arrest the Duke.</p>

<p>What ensued was a painful spectacle, Northumberland’s
bearing, even in a day when servility on the
part of the fallen was so common as to be almost a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
matter of course, being generally stigmatized as unworthy
of the man who had often given proof of
a brave and noble spirit.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> As the two men met, it
may be that the Duke augured well from the Queen’s
choice of a messenger. If he had, he was to be
quickly undeceived. Arundel was not disposed to
risk his newly acquired favour with the sovereign for
the sake of a discredited comrade, and Northumberland
might have spared the abjectness of his attitude;
as, falling on his knees, he begged his former friend,
for the love of God, to be good to him.</p>

<p>“Consider,” he urged, “I have done nothing
but by the consents of you and all the whole
Council.”</p>

<p>The plea was ill-chosen. That Arundel had been
implicated in the treason was a reason the more why
he could not afford to show mercy to a fellow-traitor;
nor was he in a mood to discuss a past he
would have preferred to forget and to blot out. It
is the unfortunate who are prone to indulge in long
memories, and the Earl had just achieved a success
which he was anxious to render permanent. Disregarding
Northumberland’s appeal, he turned at once
to the practical matter in hand. He had been sent
there by the Queen’s Majesty, he told the Duke;
in her name he arrested him.</p>

<p>Northumberland made no attempt at resistance.
He obeyed, he answered humbly; “and I beseech<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
you, my Lord of Arundel, use mercy towards me,
knowing the case as it is.”</p>

<p>Again Arundel coldly ignored the appeal to the
past.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he replied, “ye should have sought
for mercy sooner. I must do according to my
commandment,” and he handed over his prisoner
forthwith to the guards who stood near.</p>

<p>For two hours, denied so much as the services of
his attendants, the Duke paced the chamber wherein
he was confined, till, looking out of the window,
he caught sight of Arundel passing below, and
entreated that his servants might be admitted to
him.</p>

<p>“For the love of God,” he cried, “let me have
Cox, one of my chamber, to wait on me!”</p>

<p>“You shall have Tom, your boy,” answered the
Earl, naming the lad, Thomas Lovell, of whom, a
few days earlier, he had taken so affectionate a leave.
Northumberland protested.</p>

<p>“Alas, my lord,” he said, “what stead can a
boy do me? I pray you let me have Cox.” And
so both Lovell and Cox were permitted to attend
their master. It was the single concession he could
obtain.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>Thus Northumberland met his fate.</p>

<p>The Queen’s justice had overtaken more innocent
victims. Lady Jane’s stay at Sion House had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
been prolonged. By July 23, not more than three
days after she had quitted the Tower, she returned
to it, not as a Queen, but as a captive, accompanied
by the Duchess of Northumberland and Guilford
Dudley, her husband. More prisoners were quickly
added to their number. Northumberland was
brought, with others of his adherents, from
Cambridge. Northampton, who had hurried to
Framlingham, where Mary then was, to throw
himself upon her mercy, arrived soon after; with
Bishop Ridley, who, notwithstanding his recent
declamations against the Queen, had resorted with
the rest to Norfolk, had met with an unfriendly
reception from Mary, and was sent back to London
“on a halting horse.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>It is singular that to the Duke of Suffolk, prominent
amongst those who had been arrayed against
her, the new Queen showed unusual indulgence.
So far as actual deeds were concerned, he had been
second in guilt only to Northumberland; though
there can be little doubt that he was led and governed
by the stronger will and more soaring ambition of
his confederate. Lady Jane being, besides, his
daughter, and not merely married to his son, it
would have been natural to expect that he would
have been called to a stricter account than Dudley.
He was, as a matter of course, arrested and consigned
to the Tower; but when a convenient attack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
of illness laid him low&mdash;a news-letter reporting that
he was “in such case as no man judgeth he could
live”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>&mdash;and his wife represented his desperate condition
to her cousin the Queen, adding that, if left
in the Tower, death would ensue, Mary appears to
have made no difficulty in granting her his freedom,
merely ordering him to confine himself to his house,
rather as restraint than as chastisement.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>Mary could afford to show mercy. On August 3
she made her triumphal entry into the capital which
had proved so loyal to her cause, riding on a white
horse, with the Earl of Arundel bearing before her
the sword of state, and preceded by some thousand
gentlemen in rich array.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was at her side&mdash;Elizabeth, who had
learnt wisdom since the days, nearly five years ago,
when she had compromised herself for the sake of
Seymour. During the crisis now over, she had
shown both prudence and caution, playing in fact
a waiting game, as she looked on at the contest between
her sister and Northumberland, and carefully
abstaining from taking any side in it, until it should
be seen which of the two would prove victorious.
To her, as well as to Mary, a summons had been
sent as from her dying brother; more wary than
her sister, she detected the snare, and remained at
Hatfield, whilst Mary came near to falling a prey
to her enemies. At Hatfield she continued during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the ensuing days, being visited by commissioners
from Northumberland, who offered a large price, in
land and money, in exchange for her acquiescence
in Edward’s appointment of Lady Jane as his
successor. If Elizabeth loved money, she loved her
safety more; and returned an answer to the effect
that it was with her elder sister that an agreement
must be made, since in Mary’s lifetime she herself
had neither claim nor title to the succession. Leti,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>
representing her as regarding Lady Jane as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeune
étourdie</i>&mdash;the first and only time the epithet can have
been applied to Suffolk’s grave daughter&mdash;states that
she indignantly expostulated with Northumberland
upon the wrong done to herself and Mary. She is
more likely to have kept silence; and it is certain
that an opportune attack of illness afforded her an
excuse for prudent inaction. When Mary’s cause had
become triumphant she had recovered sufficiently to
proceed to London, meeting her sister on the following
day at Aldgate, and riding at her side when she made
her entry into the capital.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>QUEEN ELIZABETH.</p></div></div>

<p>The two presented a painful contrast: Mary prematurely
aged by grief and care, small and thin,
“unlike in every respect to father or mother,” says
Michele, the Venetian ambassador, “with eyes so
piercing as to inspire not only reverence, but fear”;
Elizabeth, now twenty, tall and well made, though
possessing more grace than beauty, with fine eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
and, above all, beautiful hands, “della quale fa
professione”&mdash;which she was accustomed to display.</p>

<p>Her entry into the City made, Mary proceeded,
according to ancient custom, and as her unwilling
rival had done three weeks before, to the Tower,
where a striking scene took place. On her entrance
she was met by a group of those who, imprisoned
during the two previous reigns, awaited her on their
knees. Her kinsman, Edward Courtenay, was there&mdash;since
he was ten years old he had known no other
home&mdash;and the Duchess of Somerset, widow of the
Protector, with the old Duke of Norfolk, father to
Surrey, Tunstall, the deprived Bishop of Durham,
and Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester. In Mary’s
eyes some of these were martyrs, suffering for their
fidelity to the faith for which she had herself been
prepared to go to the scaffold; for others she felt
the natural compassion due to captives who have
wasted long years within prison walls; and, touched
and overcome by the sight of that motley company,
she burst into tears.</p>

<p>“These are my prisoners,” she said, as she bent
and kissed them.</p>

<p>Their day was come. By August 11 Gardiner
was reinstated in Winchester House, which had been
appropriated to the use of the Marquis of Northampton,
now perhaps inhabiting the Bishop’s quarters
in the Tower. The Duke of Norfolk, the Duchess
of Somerset, Courtenay, were all at liberty. Bonner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
was once more exercising his functions as Bishop
of London. But their places in the old prison-house
were not left vacant: fresh captives being
sent to join those already there. Report declared&mdash;prematurely&mdash;that
sentence had been passed on
Northumberland, Huntingdon, Gates, and others.
Pembroke, notwithstanding the zealous share he
had taken in proclaiming Mary Queen, as well as
Winchester and Darcy, were confined to their houses.</p>

<p>All necessary measures had been taken for the
security of the Government. It was time to think
of the dead boy lying unburied whilst the struggle
for his inheritance had been fought out. In the
arrangements for her brother’s funeral Mary displayed
a toleration that must have gone far to raise
the hopes of the Protestant party, awaiting, in
anxiety and dread, enlightenment as to the course
the new ruler would pursue with regard to religion.
Permitting her brother’s obsequies to be celebrated
by Cranmer according to the ritual prescribed by the
reformed Prayer-book, she caused a Requiem Mass
to be sung for him in the Tower in the presence
of some hundreds of worshippers, notwithstanding
the fact that, according to Griffet, “this was not
in conformity with the laws of the Roman Church,
since the Prince died in schism and heresy.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>It was the moment when Mary, the recipient, as
she told the French ambassador, of more graces than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
any living Princess; the object of the love and
devotion of her subjects; her long years of misfortune
ended; her record unstained, should have
died. But, unfortunately, five more years of life
remained to her.</p>

<p>The presage of coming trouble was not absent in
the midst of the general rejoicing, and the first notes
of discord had already been struck. Emboldened by
the Requiem celebrated in the Tower, a priest had
taken courage, and had said Mass in the Church of
St. Bartholomew in the City. It was then seen how
far the people were from being unanimous in including
in their devotion to the Queen toleration
for her religion. “This day,” reports a news-letter
of August 11, “an old priest said Mass at
St. Bartholomew’s, but after that Mass was done,
the people would have pulled him to pieces.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
“When they saw him go up to the altar,” says
Griffet, “there was a great tumult, some attempting
to throw themselves upon him and strike him,
others trying to prevent this violence, so that there
came near to being blood shed.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>Scenes of this nature, with the open declarations
of the Protestants that they would meet the re-establishment
of the old worship with an armed
resistance, and that it would be necessary to pass
over the bodies of twenty thousand men before a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
single Mass should be quietly said in London, were
warnings of rocks ahead. That Mary recognised
the gravity of the situation was proved by the fact
that, after an interview with the Mayor, she permitted
the priest who had disregarded the law to
be put into prison, although taking care that an
opportunity of escape should shortly be afforded
him.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>A proclamation made in the middle of August
also testified to some desire upon the Queen’s part,
at this stage, to adopt a policy of conciliation. In
it she declared that it was her will “that all men
should embrace that religion which all men knew
she had of long time observed, and meant, God
willing, to continue the same; willing all men to
be quiet, and not call men the names of heretick
and papist, but each man to live after the religion
he thought best until further order were taken
concerning the same.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p>Though the liberty granted was only provisional
and temporary, there was nothing in the proclamation
to foreshadow the fires of Smithfield, and it was
calculated to allay any fears or forebodings disquieting
the minds of loyal subjects.</p>

<span class="subhead">Trial and condemnation of Northumberland&mdash;His recantation&mdash;Final
scenes&mdash;Lady Jane’s fate in the balances&mdash;A conversation
with her.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> great subject of interest agitating the
capital, when the excitement attending the
Queen’s triumphal entry had had time to subside,
was the approaching trial of the Duke of Northumberland
and his principal accomplices. On
August 18 the great conspirator, with his son, the
Earl of Warwick, and the Marquis of Northampton,
were arraigned at Westminster Hall, the Duke
of Norfolk, lately himself a prisoner, presiding, as
High Steward of England, at the trial.</p>

<p>Its issue was a foregone conclusion. If ever man
deserved to suffer the penalty for high treason, that
man was Northumberland. His brain had devised
the plot intended to keep the Queen out of the
heritage hers by birth and right; his hand had done
what was possible to execute it. He had commanded
in person the forces arrayed against her, and
had been taken, as it were, red-handed. He must
have recognised the fact that any attempt at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
defence would be hopeless. Two points of law,
however, he raised: Could a man, acting by warrant
of the great seal of England, and by the authority of
the Council, be accused of high treason? And
further, could he be judged by those who, implicated
in the same offence, were his fellow-culprits?</p>

<p>The argument was quickly disposed of. If, as
Mr. Tytler supposes,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> the Duke’s intention was to
appeal to the sanction of the great seal affixed to
Edward’s will, the judges preferred to interpret his
plea, as most historians have concurred in doing,
as referring to the seal used during Lady Jane’s
short reign; and, thus understood, the authority
of a usurper could not be allowed to exonerate
her father-in-law from the guilt of rebellion. As to
his second question, so long as those by whom
he was to be judged were themselves unattainted,
they were not disqualified from filling their office.
Sentence was passed without delay, the Duke
proffering three requests. First, he asked that
he might die the death of a noble; secondly, that
the Queen would be gracious to his children, since
they had acted by his command, and not of their
own free will; and thirdly, that two members of the
Council Board might visit him, in order that he
might declare to them matters concerning the public
welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
The trial had been conducted on a Friday. The
uncertainty prevailing as to the condition of public
sentiment in the city may be inferred from the fact,
that, when the customary sermon was to be preached
at Paul’s Cross on the following Sunday, it was
considered expedient to have the preacher chosen by
the Queen surrounded by her guards, lest a tumult
should ensue. The state of feeling in the capital must
have been curiously mixed. Mary was the lawful
sovereign, and had been brought to her rights
amidst universal rejoicing. Northumberland was an
object of detestation to the populace. Yet, whilst
the Queen was undisguisedly devoted to a religion
to which the majority of her subjects were hostile,
the Duke was regarded as, with Suffolk, the chief
representative and support of the faith they held
and the Church as by law established. If his adherence
to Protestant doctrine, as was now to appear, had
been a matter of policy rather than of conviction,
it had been singularly successful in imposing upon
the multitude; though, according to the story which
makes him observe to Sir Anthony Browne that he
certainly thought best of the old religion, “but,
seeing a new one begun, run dog, run devil, he would
go forward,” he had been at little pains to conceal
his lack of genuine sympathy with innovation.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
When the speech was made, suspicion of Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
proclivities would have been fatal to his position
and his schemes. The case was now reversed. He
was about to forfeit, by the fashion of his death,
the solitary merit he had possessed in the eyes of a
large section of his countrymen; to throw off the
mask, however carelessly it had been worn; and
to give the lie, at that supreme moment, to the
professions of years.</p>

<p>It is said that, in consequence of the request
he had preferred at his trial that he might be visited
by some members of the Council, he was granted an
interview with Gardiner and another of his colleagues,
name unknown; that the Bishop of Winchester
subsequently interceded with the Queen on his
behalf, and was sanguine of success; but that, in
deference to the Emperor’s advice, Mary decided in
the end that the Duke must die.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> To Arundel,
in spite of the little encouragement he had received
at Cambridge to hope that the Earl would prove his
friend, Northumberland wrote, begging for life,
“yea, the life of a dog, that he may but live and
kiss the Queen’s feet.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> All was in vain. Prayers,
supplications, entreaties, were useless. He was to
die.</p>

<p>Of those tried together with him, two shared his
sentence&mdash;Sir Thomas Palmer and Sir John Gates.
Monday, August 21, had been fixed for the executions,
Commendone, the Pope’s agent, delaying his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
journey to Italy at Mary’s request that he might be
present on the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> For some unexplained
reason, they were deferred. It was probably in
order to leave Northumberland time to make his
recantation at leisure; for he had expressed his
desire to renounce his errors “and to hear Mass
and to receive the Sacrament according to the old
accustomed manner.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>The account of what followed has been preserved
in detail. At nine in the morning the altar in the
chapel was prepared; and thither the Duke was
presently conducted by Sir John Gage, Constable
of the Tower, four of the lesser prisoners being
brought in by the Lieutenant. Dying men,
three of them, and the rest in jeopardy, it was
a solemn company there assembled as the officiating
priest proceeded with the ancient ritual. At a given
moment the service was interrupted, so that the
Duke might make his confession of faith and
formally abjure the new ways he had followed for
sixteen years, “the which is the only cause of the
great plagues and vengeance which hath light upon
the whole realm of England, and now likewise
worthily fallen upon me and others here present for
our unfaithfulness; ... and this I pray you all
to testify, and pray for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
After which, kneeling down, he asked forgiveness
from all, and forgave all.</p>

<p>“Amongst others standing by,” says the narrator
of the scene, “were the Duke of Somerset’s sons,”
Hertford and his brother, boys scarcely emerged
from childhood; watching the fallen enemy of
their house, and remembering that to him had been
chiefly due their father’s death.</p>

<p>Other spectators were some fourteen or fifteen
merchants from the City, bidden to the chapel
that they might witness the ceremony and perhaps
make report of the Duke’s recantation to their
fellows.</p>

<p>The news of what was going forward must have
spread through the Tower, partly palace, partly
dungeon, partly fortress; and men must have
looked strangely upon one another as they heard
that the leader principally responsible for all that
had happened in the course of the last month, to
whom the safety of the Protestant faith had been
war-cry and watchword, had abjured it as the
work of the devil. Where was truth, or sincerity,
or pure conviction to be found?</p>

<p>Of Lady Jane, during this day, there is but one
mention. The limelight had been turned off her
small figure, and she had fallen back into obscurity.
Yet we hear that, looking through a window, she
had seen her father-in-law led to the chapel, where
he was, in her eyes, to imperil his soul. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
whether she had been made aware of what was in
contemplation we are ignorant.</p>

<p>The final scene took place on the succeeding day.
At nine o’clock the scaffold was ready, and Sir John
Gates, with young Lord Warwick, were brought
forth to receive Communion in the chapel (“Memorandum,”
says the chronicler again, “the Duke of
Somerset’s sons stood by”). By one after the other,
their abjuration had been made, and the priest
present had offered what comfort he might to the
men appointed to die.</p>

<p>“I would,” he said, “ye should not be ignorant
of God’s mercy, which is infinite. And let not
death fear you, for it is but a little while, ye know,
ended in one half-hour. What shall I say? I
trust to God it shall be to you a short passage
(though somewhat sharp) out of innumerable miseries
into a most pleasant rest&mdash;which God grant.”</p>

<p>As the other prisoners were led out the Duke and
Sir John Gates met at the garden gate. Northumberland
spoke.</p>

<p>“Sir John,” he said, “God have mercy on us,
for this day shall end both our lives. And I pray
you, forgive me whatsoever I have offended; and
I forgive you, with all my heart, although you and
your counsel was a great occasion thereof.”</p>

<p>“Well, my Lord,” was the reply, “I forgive you,
as I would be forgiven. And yet you and your
authority was the only original cause of all together.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
But the Lord pardon you, and I pray you forgive
me.”</p>

<p>So, not without a recapitulation of each one’s
grievance, they made obeisance, and the Duke
passed on. Again, “the Duke of Somerset’s sons
stood thereby”&mdash;the words recur like a sinister
refrain.</p>

<p>The end had come. Standing upon the scaffold,
the Duke put off his damask gown; then, leaning on
the rail, he repeated the confession of faith made on
the previous day, begging those present to remember
the old learning, and thanking God that He
had called him to be a Christian. With his own
hands he knit the handkerchief about his eyes,
laid him down, and so met the executioner’s
blow.</p>

<p>Gates followed, with few words. Sir Thomas
Palmer, having witnessed the ghastly spectacle, came
last. That morning, whilst preparations for the
executions were being made, he had been walking
in the Lieutenant’s garden, observed, says that
“resident in the Tower” in whose diary so many
incidents of this time have been preserved, to seem
“more cheerful in countenance than when he was
most at liberty in his lifetime”; and when the
end was at hand, he met it, as some men did meet
death in those days, with undaunted courage, and
with a heroism not altogether unaffected by dramatic
instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Though apparently implicitly included amongst the
prisoners who had made their peace with the Church,
he is not recorded to have taken any prominent part
in the affair, and his dying speech dealt with no controversial
matters, but with eternal verities confessed
alike by Catholic and Protestant. At his trial he had
denied that he had ever borne arms against the Queen;
though, charged with having been present when others
did so, he acknowledged his guilt. He now passed
that matter over, with a brief admission that his fate
had been deserved at God’s hands: “For I know it
to be His divine ordinance by this mean to call me
to His mercy and to teach me to know myself, what
I am, and whereto we are all subject. I thank His
merciful goodness, for He has caused me to learn
more in one little dark corner in yonder Tower than
ever I learned by any travail in so many places as I
have been.” For there he had seen God; he had
seen himself; he had seen and known what the
world was. “Finally, I have seen there what death
is, how near hanging over every man’s head, and yet
how uncertain the time, and how unknown to all
men, and how little it is to be feared. And why
should I fear death, or be sad therefore? Have
I not seen two die before mine eyes, yea, and within
the hearing of mine ears? No, neither the sprinkling
of the blood, or the shedding thereof, nor the
bloody axe itself, shall not make me afraid.”</p>

<p>Taking leave of all present, he begged their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
prayers, forgave the executioner, and, master of
himself to the last, kneeling, laid his head upon the
block.</p>

<p>“I will see how meet the block is for my neck,”
he said, “I pray thee, strike me not yet, for I have
a few prayers to say. And that done, strike in God’s
name. Good leave have thou.”</p>

<p>So the scene came to an end. The three rebels
whose life Mary had taken&mdash;no large number&mdash;had
paid the forfeit of their deed. That night the
Lancaster Herald, a dependant of the Duke of
Northumberland, more faithful to old ties and
memories than those in higher place, sought the
Queen, and begged of her his master’s head, that
he might give it sepulture. In God’s name, Mary
bade him take his lord’s whole body and bury him.
By a curious caprice of destiny the Duke was laid to
rest in the Tower at the side of Somerset.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> There,
in the reconciliation of a common defeat, the ancient
rivals were united.</p>

<p>The three chief victims had thus paid the supreme
penalty. The rest of the participators in Northumberland’s
guilt, if not pardoned, were suffered to escape
with life. Young Warwick had shared his father’s
condemnation, and, finding that the excuse of youth
was not to be allowed to avail in so grave a matter,
had contented himself with begging that, out of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
goods, forfeited to the Crown, his debts might be
paid. Returning to the Tower, he had afterwards
followed his father’s example in abjuring Protestantism,
and had listened, with the older victims, to the
words addressed by the priest to the men appointed
to die. Whether or not he had been aware that
he was to be spared, Mass concluded, he had been
taken back to his lodging and had not shared the
Duke’s fate.</p>

<p>Northampton’s defence had been a strange one.
He had, he said, forborne the execution of any
public office during the interregnum and, being
intent on hunting and other sports, had not shared
in the conspiracy. The plea was not allowed to
stand, but though he, like Warwick, was condemned,
he was likewise permitted to escape with life. As
Warwick’s youth may have made its appeal to
Mary, so she may have remembered that Northampton
was the brother of her dead friend, Katherine Parr,
and have allowed that memory to save him.</p>

<p>Lady Jane’s fate had hung in the balances. By
some she was still considered a menace to the
stability of her cousin’s throne. Charles V.’s ambassadors,
representing to the Queen the need of
proceeding with caution in matters of religion, urged
the necessity of executing punishment upon the more
guilty of those who had striven to deprive her of
her crown, clemency being used towards the rest.
In which class was Jane to be included? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
determination of that question would decide her
fate. At an interview between Mary and Simon
Renard, one of the Emperor’s envoys, it was
discussed, the Queen declaring that she could not
make up her mind to send Lady Jane to the scaffold;
that she had been told that, before her marriage with
Guilford Dudley, she had been bestowed upon
another man by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">contrat obligatoire</i>, rendering the
subsequent tie null and void. Mary drew from
this hypothetical fact the inference that her cousin
was not the daughter-in-law of the Duke of
Northumberland’s, adding that she had had no
share in his undertaking, and that, as she was
innocent, it would be against her own conscience
to put her to death.</p>

<p>Renard demurred. He said, what was probably
true, that it was to be feared that the alleged contract
of marriage had been invented to save Lady Jane;
and it would be necessary at the least to keep her
a prisoner, since many inconveniences might be
expected were she set at liberty. To this Mary
agreed, promising that her cousin should not be
liberated without all precautions necessary to ensure
that no ill results would follow.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>This interview must have taken place shortly
before Northumberland’s death; for on August 23
the Emperor, to whom it had been duly reported,
was replying by a reiteration of his opinion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
all those who had conspired against the Queen, as
well as any concerned in Edward’s death, should be
chastised without mercy. He advised that the
executions should take place simultaneously, so that
the pardon of the less guilty should follow without
delay. If Mary was unable to resolve to put
“Jeanne de Suffolck” to death, she ought at least
to relegate her to some place of security, where she
could be kept under supervision and rendered
incapable of causing trouble in the realm.</p>

<p>That Mary had decided upon this course is clear,
and there is no reason to believe that Lady Jane
would have suffered death had it not been for
her father’s subsequent conduct. In the meantime,
she remained a prisoner in the Tower, and on
August 29, eleven days after the executions on
Tower Hill, she is shown to us in one of the rare
pictures left of her during the time of her captivity.
On that day&mdash;a Tuesday&mdash;the diarist in the Tower, admitted
to dine at the same table as the royal prisoner,
placed upon record an account of the conversation.</p>

<p>Besides Lady Jane, who sat at the end of the
board, there was present the narrator himself, one
Partridge,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> and his wife&mdash;it was in “Partridge’s
house,” or lodging within the Tower, that the
guests met&mdash;with Lady Jane’s gentlewoman and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
her man. Her presence had been unexpected by
the diarist, as he was careful to explain, excusing
his boldness in having accepted Partridge’s invitation
on the score that he had not been aware that she
dined below.</p>

<p>Lady Jane did not appear anxious to stand on
her dignity. Desiring guest and host to be covered,
she drank to the new-comer and made him welcome.
The conversation turned, naturally enough, upon the
conduct of public affairs, of which Lady Jane was
inclined to take a sanguine view.</p>

<p>“The Queen’s Majesty is a merciful Princess,”
she observed. “I beseech God she may long continue,
and send His merciful grace upon her.”</p>

<p>Religious matters were discussed, Lady Jane
inquiring as to who had been the preacher at
St. Paul’s the preceding Sunday.</p>

<p>“I pray you,” she asked next, “have they Mass
in London?”</p>

<p>“Yea, forsooth,” was the answer, “in some
places.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” she said. “It is not so strange
as the sudden conversion of the late Duke. For
who would have thought he would have so done?”
negativing at once and decidedly the suggestion
made by some one present that a hope of escaping
his imminent doom and winning pardon from the
Queen might supply an explanation of his change
of front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
“‘Pardon?’ repeated the dead man’s daughter-in-law.
‘Woe worth him! He hath brought me
and our stock into most miserable calamity and
misery by his exceeding ambition. But for the
answering that he hoped for life by his turning,
though other men be of that opinion, I utterly am
not. For what man is there living, I pray you,
although he had been innocent, that would hope
of life in that case; being in the field against the
Queen in person as general, and, after his taking,
so hated and evil spoken of by the commons? and
at his coming into prison so wondered at as the like
was never heard by any man’s time? Who was
judge that he should hope for pardon, whose life
was odious to all men? But what will ye more?
Like as his life was wicked and full of dissimulation,
so was his end thereafter. I pray God I, nor no
friend of mine, die so. Should I who [am] young
and in my fewers [few years?] forsake my faith for
the love of life? Nay, God forbid, much more he
should not, whose fatal course, although he had
lived his just number of years, could not have long
continued. But life was sweet, it appeared; so he
might have lived, you will say, he did [not] care
how. Indeed the reason is good, he that would have
lived in chains, to have had his life, by like would
leave no other means attempted. But God be merciful
to us, for He saith, whoso denyeth Him before
men, He will not know in His Father’s Kingdom.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
The conviction of Northumberland’s daughter-in-law
that his recantation had not been a mere
device designed to lengthen his days may be allowed
in some sort to weigh in favour of the man she
hated; and it is also fair to remember that if his
first abjuration may be accounted for by a lingering
hope that it might purchase life, any such expectation
must have been abandoned before the final repetition
of it upon the scaffold. In Lady Jane’s eyes, however,
there seems to have been little to choose
between a sham apostacy and a genuine reversion
to his older creed.</p>

<p>“With this and much like talk the dinner passed
away,” and with exchange of courtesies the little
company separated. The brief shaft of light throwing
Lady Jane’s figure into relief fades and leaves her
once more in the shadow&mdash;a shadow that was to
deepen above her till the end. It was early days of
captivity still. Yet one discerns something of the
passionate longing of the prisoner for freedom in
her wonder that life in chains could be accounted
worth any sacrifice.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> Mary there were at present matters of more
personal and pressing moment than the fate
of her ill-starred cousin. It was essential that the
kingdom should be provided as quickly as possible
with an heir whose title to the throne should admit
of no question. Mary was no longer young and
there was no time to lose. The question in all
men’s minds was who was to be the Queen’s
husband. Amongst Englishmen, Pole, who, though
a Cardinal, was not in priest’s orders, and Courtenay,
the prisoner of the Tower, were both of royal blood,
and considered in the light of possible aspirants to
her hand. The first, however, was soon set aside,
as disqualified by age and infirmity. Towards
Courtenay she appeared for a time not ill-disposed.
His unhappy youth, his long captivity, may have
told in his favour in the eyes of a woman herself
the victim of injustice and misfortune. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
young, not more than twenty-seven, handsome&mdash;called
by Castlenau “l’un des plus beaux entre les
jeunes seigneurs de son âge”&mdash;and the Queen
cherished a special affection for his mother. He
had been restored to the forfeited honours of his
family, had been made Earl of Devonshire and
Knight of the Bath. Gardiner also, whose opinion
carried weight, was an advocate of the match. But
on his enfranchisement from prison the young
man had not used his liberty wisely. His head
turned by the position already his, and the chance
of a higher one, he had started his household on
a princely scale, inducing many of the courtiers to
kneel in his presence. Follies such as these Mary
might have condoned, although the fact that she
directed her cousin to accept no invitations to dinner
without her permission indicates the exercise of a
supervision somewhat like that to be kept over an
emancipated schoolboy. But at a moment when he
was aspiring to the highest rank to be enjoyed by
any subject, his moral misconduct was matter
of public report and sufficient to deter any woman
from becoming his wife. He was also headstrong
and self-willed, “so difficult to guide,” sighed
Noailles, “that he will believe nobody; and as
one who has spent his life in a tower, seeing
himself now in the enjoyment of entire liberty,
cannot abstain from its delights, having no fear of
those things which may be placed before him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
To these causes, rather than to the romantic
passion for Elizabeth attributed to Courtenay by
some other writers, Dr. Lingard attributes Mary’s
refusal to entertain the idea of becoming his wife.
“In public she observed that it was not for her
honour to marry a subject, but to her confidential
friends she attributed the cause to the immorality
of Courtenay.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>Her two English suitors disposed of, it remained
to select a husband from amongst foreign princes&mdash;the
King of Denmark, the Prince of Spain, the
Infant of Portugal, the Prince of Piedmont, being
all under consideration. A few months ago Mary
had been a negligible quantity in the marriage
market; she had now become one of the most
desirable matches in Europe. She was determined
to follow in her choice the advice of the
Emperor; and the Emperor had hitherto abstained
from proffering it, contenting himself with negativing
the candidature of the son of the King of the
Romans. It was not until September 20 that, in
answer to her repeated inquiries, he instructed his
ambassadors to offer her the hand of his son;
requesting that the matter should be kept secret,
even from her ministers of State, until he had been
informed whether she was inclined to accept his
suggestion.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> The contents of the Emperor’s despatch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
must have been communicated to the Queen immediately
before her coronation on September 30;
but not being as yet made public there was nothing
to interfere with the loyal rejoicings of the people,
to whom the very idea of the Spanish match would
have been abhorrent.</p>

<p>Meantime the attitude of Elizabeth was increasing
the desire of the Catholic party that a direct heir
should be born to the Catholic Queen. The nation
was insensibly dividing itself into two camps, and
the Protestant and Catholic parties eyed one another
with suspicion, each looking to the sister who shared
its faith for support. The enthusiasm displayed
towards Elizabeth by a section of the people was not
conducive to the continuance of affectionate relations
between the Queen and the next heir to the
throne, Pope Julius describing the younger sister
as being in the heart and mouth of every one.
Elizabeth was in a position of no little difficulty.
She desired to continue on good terms with the
Queen; she was not willing to relinquish her chief
title to honour in Protestant eyes; and it is possible
that genuine religious sentiment, a sincere preference
for the creed she professed, may have added to her
embarrassment. It may have been due to conviction
that she declined to bow to her sister’s wishes by
attending Mass, refusing so much as to be present
at the ceremonial which created Courtenay Earl
of Devonshire. It was satisfactory to know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Protestant England looked on and applauded. It
was less pleasant to hear that some of the Queen’s
hot-headed friends, interpreting her refusal as an act
of disrespect to their mistress, had demanded&mdash;though
vainly&mdash;her arrest; and though on September 6
Noailles reported to his master that on
the previous Saturday and Sunday the Princess had
proved deaf to the arguments of preachers and the
solicitations of Councillors, and had gone so far as to
make a rude reply to the last, she suddenly changed
her tactics, fell on her knees, weeping, before Mary,
and begged that books and teachers might be supplied
to her, so that she might perhaps see cause to alter
the faith in which she had been brought up. The
expectation seems to have been promptly realised.
On September 8 she accompanied the Queen to
Mass, and, expressing an intention of establishing a
chapel in her house, wrote to the Emperor to
ask permission to purchase the ornaments for it
in Brussels.</p>

<p>It was a season of sudden conversions. Elizabeth
was not the only person who saw the wisdom of
conforming in appearance or in sincerity to the
standard set up by the Queen. Hardinge, a chaplain
of the Duke of Suffolk’s&mdash;he must have succeeded
to the post of the worthy Haddon&mdash;had recognized
his errors; and it is believed that to him a letter
of Lady Jane’s&mdash;though signed with her unmarried
name&mdash;was addressed. Printed in English, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
abroad, perhaps through the instrumentality of her
former tutor, Aylmer, it is an epistle of expostulation,
reproof, and warning, couched in the violent language
of the time. To her “noble friend, newly fallen
from the truth” she writes, marvelling at him, and
lamenting the case of one who, once the lively
member of Christ, was now the deformed imp of
the devil, and from the temple of God was become
the kennel of Satan&mdash;with much more in the same
strain. It has not been recorded what effect, if any,
the missive produced upon the delinquent to whom
it was addressed.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, for her part, had effectually made
her peace with her sister. The coronation, on
October 10, found their relations restored to a
pleasant footing, and Elizabeth’s proper place at
the ceremony was assured to her. To Mary, a sad
and lonely woman, the reconciliation must have been
welcome. To Elizabeth the material advantages
of standing on terms of affection with the Queen
will have appealed more strongly than motives
of sentiment; and that her attitude was surmised
by those about her would seem to be shown by
a curious incident reported in the despatches of the
imperial ambassador.</p>

<p>As the younger sister bore the crown to be placed
upon Mary’s head, she complained to M. de Noailles,
who stood near, of its weight. It was heavy, she
said, and she was weary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
The Frenchman replied with a flippant jest,
overheard by Charles’s ambassador, though Noailles
himself, perhaps convicted of indiscretion, makes
no mention of it in his account of the day’s proceedings.
Let Elizabeth have patience, he replied.
When the crown should shortly be upon her own
head it would appear lighter.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>Outwardly all was as it should be. Mary held
her sister’s hand in an affectionate clasp, assigning
to her the place of honour next her own at the
ensuing banquet, and court and nation looked on
and were edified.</p>

<p>Gardiner, now not only Bishop of Winchester
but Lord Chancellor, had performed the rites of the
coronation, in the absence of the Archbishops, both
in confinement. The Tower had been once more
opening its hospitable doors, and a fortnight earlier
its resident diarist had noted Cranmer’s arrival.
“Item, the Bishop of Canterbury was brought
into the Tower as prisoner, and lodged in the
Tower over the gate anenst the water-gate, where
the Duke of Northumberland lay before his death.”</p>

<p>Nor was Cranmer the only churchman to find
a lodging there. Doctor Ridley had preceded
him to the universal prison-house, and on the
same day that the Archbishop took up his residence
in it “Master Latimer was brought to the Tower
prisoner; who at his coming said to one Rutter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
a warder there, ‘What, my old friend, how do you?
I am now come to be your neighbour again,’ and
was lodged in the garden in Sir Thomas Palmer’s
lodging.”</p>

<p>Ominous quarters both! It was a day when
the great fortress received, and discharged, many
guests.</p>

<p>If Cranmer had drawn his imprisonment upon
himself, the imprudence to which it was due did
him honour. He had at first been treated by
Mary with an indulgence the more singular when
it is remembered that he had been the instrument
of her mother’s divorce, and a strenuous
supporter of Lady Jane. Prudence would have
dictated the adoption on his part of a policy of
silence; but, confined to his house at Lambeth,
and regarding with the bitterness inevitable in a
man of his convictions the steps in course of being
taken for the restoration of the ancient worship,
the news that Mass had been once again celebrated
in Canterbury Cathedral, and that it was commonly
reported that it had been done with his consent
and connivance, was too much for him. Feeling
the need of clearing himself from what he regarded
as a damaging imputation, he wrote and spread
abroad a declaration of his faith and opinions,
adding to it a violent attack upon the rites of
the Catholic Church. By Mary and her advisers
the challenge could scarcely have been ignored;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and it was this document, read to the people in
the streets, which was the cause of the Archbishop
being called before the Council and committed to
the Tower on a charge of treason accompanied by
the spreading abroad of seditious libels.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>The Tower continued to be, in some sort,
the centre of all that was going forward. On
September 27, two days before the coronation,
Mary had again visited the fortress whither she
had so nearly escaped being brought in quite another
character and guise. Elizabeth came with her, and
she was attended by the whole Council&mdash;just as they
had, not three months before, attended upon Jane,
the innocent usurper. And somewhere in the
great dark building the little Twelfth-night Queen
must have listened to the pealing of the joy-bells
and to the acclamations of the people who had
kept so ominous a silence when she herself had
made her entry. Perhaps young Guilford Dudley
too, who a week or two before had been accorded
“the liberty of the leads on Beacham’s Tower,”
may have stood above, catching a glimpse of the
show, and remembering the day when he and his
wife had their boy-and-girl quarrel, because she
would not make him a King.</p>

<p>The two questions of the hour were those
relating to the Queen’s marriage and to matters
of religion. When Parliament met on October 5,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the news of the Spanish match had not been announced,
and the bills of chief interest passed were
one dealing with the important point of the validity
of Katherine of Aragon’s marriage, and a second,
which, avoiding any discussion of the Papal
supremacy, the only thoroughly unpopular article
of the Catholic creed, cancelled recent legislation
on ecclesiastical matters, and restored the ritual
in use during the last year of Henry’s reign. The
other important measure carried in this session was
the attainder of Cranmer, Lady Jane and her
husband, and Sir Ambrose Dudley.</p>

<p>So far as Lady Jane was concerned the step was
purely formal, intended to serve as a warning to
her friends, and it was understood on all hands that
a pardon would be granted to the guiltless figure-head
of the conspiracy. Yet to a nervous child,
not yet seventeen, there may well have been something
terrifying in the sentence hanging over her,
and it seems to have been about this time that she
addressed a letter to her father which could scarcely
have been otherwise conceived had she expected in
truth to suffer the penalty due to treason.</p>

<p>“If I may without offence rejoice in mine own
mishap,” she wrote, “meseems in this I may
account myself blessed, that washing mine hands
with the innocency of my fact, my guiltless blood
may cry before the Lord, mercy, mercy to the
innocent. And yet I must acknowledge that being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
constrained, and, as you wot well enough, continually
assailed, in taking upon me I seemed to consent, and
therein offended the Queen and her laws, yet do I
assuredly trust that this mine offence towards God
is much the less, in that being in so royal an estate
as I was, mine enforced honour never agreed with
mine innocent heart.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>The trial was held on November 13, on which
day Cranmer, with Guilford, and his brother, and
Lady Jane, were all conducted on foot to the
Guildhall to answer the charge of treason.</p>

<p>The Archbishop led the way, followed by young
Dudley. After them came Lady Jane, a childish
figure of woe, dressed in black, with a French hood,
also black, a book bound in black velvet hanging at
her side, and another in her hand.</p>

<p>Her condemnation was a foregone conclusion,
and, pleading guilty, she was sentenced to death,
by the axe or by fire, according to the old brutal
law dealing with a woman convicted of treason.
As she returned to the Tower a demonstration took
place in her honour, not unlikely to be productive
of some uneasiness to those in power, and little
calculated to serve her cause.</p>

<p>The London populace were more favourably
disposed towards her in misfortune, than in her
brief period of prosperity. The sight of the
forlorn pair, still no more than boy and girl,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
touched and moved the multitude, and crowds
accompanied them to their place of captivity. It
is said that this was the solitary occasion upon
which she and Guilford Dudley met during their
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Another cause, besides simple pity, was perhaps
responsible for the tenderness displayed towards
the Queen’s rival. A week or two before the trial
the news of the Spanish match had been made
known to the public, and may have had the effect
of suggesting doubts as to the wisdom of the
enthusiastic welcome given to Mary. At the
beginning of November the affair had been undecided,
and Gardiner was telling the Emperor’s
envoy candidly that, if the Queen asked his advice,
he would counsel her to choose an Englishman for
her husband. The nation, he added, was deeply
prejudiced against foreign domination, especially in
the case of Spaniards, and the proposed union
would also produce war with France.</p>

<p>Mary’s mind, however, was made up, nor had
she any intention of being swayed by Gardiner’s
advice. On the night of October 30 she took
the singular step of summoning the ambassador,
Simon Renard, to her apartment; when, in the
presence of the Blessed Sacrament, and after repeating
on her knees the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Veni Creator</i>, she gave
him her promise to wed the Prince of Spain. In
the face of the curious determination thus shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
to bind herself by a contract irrevocable in her own
eyes, it is strange to find historians attributing to
her a continued leaning towards Courtenay.</p>

<p>When the fact got abroad that the Emperor’s
son was destined to become the Queen’s husband,
London thrilled with indignation; whilst Parliament
made its sentiments plain by means of a deputation
which, in an address containing an entreaty that
she would marry, expressed a hope that her choice
would fall upon an Englishman. But Mary was
a Tudor. Dispensing with the customary medium
of the Chancellor, she gave her reply in person.
Thanking the petitioners for their zeal, she declared
herself disposed to act upon their advice and to
take a husband. It was, however, for herself alone
to select one, according to her inclination, and for
the good of her kingdom.</p>

<p>Simon Renard, reporting the scene, observed that
her speech had been applauded by the nobles present,
Arundel informing the Chancellor in jest that he
had been deprived of his office, since the Queen
had undertaken the functions belonging to it.
In the pleasantry the Emperor’s envoy detected a
warning that should Gardiner continue his opposition
to the match he would not long retain his present
post.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>The Bishop yielded. He may have agreed with
Renard. At all events, the Queen being determined,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
and recognising that he was unable to deter her
from the measure upon which she had decided,
he took the prudent step of putting himself on her
side. His opposition removed, Renard was able
to inform his master, on December 17, that Mary
had received him in open daylight, had informed
him that the necessity for secrecy was at an end,
and that she regarded her marriage as a thing
definitely and irrevocably fixed.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the year 1553 drew towards its close
there was nothing to indicate that any
catastrophe was at hand. The crisis appeared to
be past and no further danger to be apprehended.
Northumberland and his principal accomplices had
paid the penalty of their treason. Suffolk, with
lesser criminals, had been allowed to escape it; the
rest of the confederates had been practically pardoned.
If some were still in confinement it was
understood to be without danger to life or limb.
In the Tower Lady Jane and her husband lay
formally under sentence of death, but the conditions
of their captivity had been lightened; on
December 18 Lady Jane was accorded “the liberty
of the Tower,” and was permitted to walk in the
Queen’s garden and on the hill; Guilford and
his brother&mdash;Elizabeth’s Leicester&mdash;were allowed
the liberty of the leads in the Bell Tower. Both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Northampton and young Warwick&mdash;who did not
long survive his enfranchisement&mdash;had been released.
No further chastisement seemed likely to be inflicted
in expiation of the late attempt to keep Mary
out of her rights.</p>

<p>Yet discontent was on the increase. As early as
November steps had been taken to induce Courtenay
to head a new conspiracy. He was timid and
faint-hearted, and urged delay, and nothing had,
so far, come of it. It would be well, he said, advocating
a policy of procrastination, to wait to be
certain that the Queen was determined upon the
Spanish match before taking hazardous measures to
oppose it.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>Thus Christmas had found the country ostensibly
at peace, and the prisoners in the Tower with no
reason to fear any change for the worse in their
condition. On the following day the thunder
of the cannon discharged as a welcome to the
Emperor’s ambassadors sounded in their ears, and
was, though they were ignorant of it, the prelude
of their destruction. The arrival of envoys expressly
charged with the marriage negotiations put
the matter beyond doubt; nor was England in a mood
to submit passively to a union it hated and feared.</p>

<p>By January 2 the Counts of Egmont and Laing
and the Sieur de Corriers had reached the capital;
landing at the Tower, where they were greeted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
with a salute from the guns, and met by the Earl
of Devonshire, who escorted them through the
City. “The people, nothing rejoicing, held down
their heads sorrowfully.” When on the previous
day the retinue of the Spanish envoys had ridden
through the town, more forcible expression had been
given to public opinion, and they had been pelted
with snowballs.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>Matters were pressed quickly on. By January 13
the formal announcement of the unpopular arrangement,
with its provisions, was made by Gardiner in
the Presence-chamber at Westminster to the lords
and nobles there assembled; hope could no longer
be entertained that the Queen would be otherwise
persuaded. “These news,” adds the Tower diarist,
“although they were not unknown to many and
very much disliked, yet being now in this wise
pronounced, was not only credited, but also heavily
taken of sundry men; yea, and almost each man
was abashed, looking daily for worse matters to
grow shortly after.”</p>

<p>They did not look in vain. The unpopularity of
the Spanish match was the direct cause of the
insurrections which soon broke out. Indirectly it
was the cause of the death of Lady Jane Grey.</p>

<p>Wild tales were afloat, rousing the passions of the
angry people to fever-heat. Some reports stated
that Edward was still alive; others asserted that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the tower and the forts were to be seized and held
by an imperialist army; abuse of every kind was
directed against the Prince of Spain and his nation.
Mary was said to have given her pledge that she
would marry no foreigner, and by the breach of
this promise she was declared to have forfeited the
crown. Fresh schemes were set on foot for a
rising in the spring. It does not appear that the
substitution of Lady Jane for her cousin was again
generally contemplated. That plan had resulted
in so complete a failure that it had probably been
tacitly admitted that the arrangement would not
work. But the eyes of many were turning towards
Elizabeth. She was to wed Courtenay, and they
were jointly to occupy the throne. The two
principally concerned were not likely to have refused
to fall in with the project had it seemed to offer a fair
chance of success, and France was in favour of it.</p>

<p>“By what I hear,” wrote Noailles, “it will be
by my Lord Courtenay’s own fault if he does not
marry her, and she does not follow him to Devonshire,”&mdash;the
selected centre of operations&mdash;“but the
misfortune is that the said Courtenay is in such
fear that he dares undertake nothing. I see no
reason that prevents him save lack of heart.”</p>

<p>Courtenay was in truth not the stuff of which
conductors of revolutions are made. Gratitude
and loyalty would not have availed to keep
him true to Mary, and in able hands he might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
have become the instrument of a rebellion. But
Gardiner found no difficulty in so playing on his
apprehensions as to lead him to divulge the plots
that were on foot; and his revelations, or betrayals,
whichever they are to be called, precipitated the
action of the conspirators. If their enterprise was
to be attempted, no time must be lost.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>On January 20 it became known that Devonshire
was in arms, “resisting the King of Spain’s coming,”
and that Exeter was in the hands of the insurgents.
By the 25th the Duke of Suffolk, with his two
brothers, Lord John and Lord Leonard Grey, had
fled from his house at Sheen, and gone northwards
to rouse his Warwickshire tenants to insurrection.
It was currently reported that he had narrowly
escaped being detained, a messenger from the Queen
having arrived as he was on the point of starting,
with orders that he should repair to Court.</p>

<p>“Marry,” said the Duke, “I was coming to
her Grace. Ye may see I am booted and spurred
ready to ride, and I will but break my fast and go.”</p>

<p>Bestowing a present upon the messenger, he gave
him drink, and himself departed, no one then knew
whither.</p>

<p>That same day tidings had reached the Council
that Kent had risen, Sir Thomas Wyatt at its head,
with Culpepper, Cobham, and others, alleging, as
their sole motives, resistance to the Prince of Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and the removal of certain lords from the Council
Board. Sir John Crofts had proceeded to Wales
to call upon it to join the insurrectionary movement.</p>

<p>The country being thus in a turmoil the two
persons who should have taken the lead and
upon whom much of the success of the insurgents
depended were playing a cautious game. Courtenay
was at Court, and Elizabeth remained at Ashridge
to watch the event, no doubt prepared to shape
her course accordingly. A letter addressed to
her by her partisans, counselling her withdrawal
to Dunnington, as to a place of greater safety, had
been intercepted by the authorities; and she had
received an invitation, or command, to join her sister
at St. James’s, where, it was significantly added, she
would be more secure than either at Ashridge or
Dunnington. On the score of ill-health she
disobeyed the summons, fortifying the house, and
assembling around it some numbers of armed
retainers.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>HENRY GREY, DUKE OF SUFFOLK, K.G.</p></div></div>

<p>The hopes built by the insurgents upon the general
discontent throughout the country were doomed to
disappointment. It was one thing to disapprove of
the Queen’s choice; it was quite another to take
up arms against her. Devonshire proved cold;
most of the leaders there were seized, or compelled
to make their escape to France; Crofts had been
pursued to Wales, and was arrested before he had
time to rally any support in the principality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Suffolk had done no better in the Midlands.
Authorities are divided as to his intentions. By
Dr. Lingard it is considered uncertain whether
he meant to press Elizabeth’s claims or to revive
those of his daughter. With either upon the
throne the dominance of the Protestant religion
would have been ensured, and, unlike Northumberland,
Suffolk was sincere and honest in his attachment
to the principles of the Reformation. Other writers,
however, assert categorically that he caused Lady
Jane to be proclaimed at his halting-places as he
went north; and the sequel seems to make it
probable that she had been once more forced into
a position of dangerous prominence.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the exact nature of
the scheme he propounded, the country made no
response to his appeal; after a skirmish near Coventry
he gave up hopes of any immediate success, disbanded
his followers, and, betrayed by a tenant
upon whose fidelity he had believed he could count,
fell into the hands of those in pursuit of him. By
February 10 he had gone to swell the numbers
of the prisoners in the Tower.</p>

<p>The rising in Kent had alone answered in any
degree to the expectations of its promoters.
Drawn into the conspiracy, if his own assertions
are to be credited, by Courtenay, Wyatt had
become the most conspicuous leader of the insurrection
known by his name. He was well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
fitted for the post. Brave, skilful, and secret, he
was, says Noailles, “un gentilhomme le plus vaillant
et assuré que j’ai jamais ouï parler”; and whether
or not he had been deserted by the man to whom
it was due that he had taken up arms, he was
not disposed to submit to defeat without a struggle.</p>

<p>Fixing his headquarters at Rochester, he had
gathered together a body of some fifteen thousand
men, and was there found by the Duke of Norfolk,
sent at the head of the Queen’s forces against him.
The utmost enthusiasm prevailed amongst the
insurgents, and when a herald arrived in Rochester
commissioned by the Duke to proclaim a pardon
for all who would consent to lay down arms, “each
man cried that they had done nothing wherefore
they should need any pardon, and that quarrel
which they took they would die and live in it.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>
Sir George Harper was in fact the sole rebel who
accepted the proffered boon.</p>

<p>Worse was to follow. At the first encounter
of the royal troops with the Kentish men Captain
Bret, leading five hundred Londoners, went over
to the rebels, explaining in a spirited speech
the grounds for his desertion, the miseries which
might be expected to befall the nation should the
Spaniards bear rule over it, and expressing his
determination to spend his blood “in the quarrel
of this worthy captain, Master Wyatt.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
It was an ominous beginning to the struggle,
and at the applause greeting Bret’s announcement,
the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Ormond, and
Jerningham, Captain of the Guard, fled. Wyatt,
taking instant advantage of the situation, rode
in amongst the Queen’s troops, crying out that
any who desired to join him should be welcome
and that those who wished might depart.</p>

<p>Most of the men accepted the alternative of
throwing in their lot with Wyatt and his company,
leaving their leaders to return without them to
London. “Ye should have seen,” adds the diarist,
from whom these details and many others of this
episode are taken, “some of the Guard come home,
their coats turned, all ruined, without arrows or
string in their bow, or sword, in very strange wise;
which discomfiture, like as it was very heart-sore
and displeasing to the Queen and Council, even so
it was almost no less joyous to the Londoners and
most part of others.”</p>

<p>With the capital in this temper, the juncture
was a critical one. Wyatt was marching on London,
and who could say what reception he would meet
with at the hands of the discontented populace?
The fact that he was encountered at Deptford by a
deputation from the Council, sent to inquire into his
demands, is proof of the apprehensions entertained.
The interview did not end amicably. Flushed
with victory, Wyatt was not disposed to be moderate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
To Sir Edward Hastings, who asked the reason why,
calling himself a true subject, he played the part of
a traitor, he answered boldly that he had assembled
the people to defend the realm from the danger of
being overrun by strangers, a result which must
follow from the proposed marriage of the Queen.</p>

<p>Hastings temporised. No stranger was yet come
who need be suspected. Therefore, if this was
their only quarrel, the Queen would be content
they should be heard.</p>

<p>“To that I yield,” returned Wyatt warily, “but
for my further surety I would rather be trusted
than trust.”</p>

<p>In carrying out this principle of caution it was
reported that he had pressed his demand for confidence
so far as to require that the custody of
the Tower, and the Queen’s person within it,
should be conceded to him. If this was the case,
he can scarcely have felt much surprise that the
negotiations were brought to an abrupt conclusion,
Hastings replying hotly that before his traitorous
conditions should be granted, Wyatt and twenty
thousand with him should die. And thus the
conference ended.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>London was in a ferment. Mayor, aldermen,
and many of the citizens went about in armour,
“the lawyers pleaded their causes in harness,” and
when Dr. Weston said Mass before the Queen on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Ash Wednesday he wore a coat of mail beneath
his vestments. There had been no need to bid
the Spanish ambassadors to depart, those gentlemen
having prudently decamped as speedily as possible.
Upon February 2 Mary in person proceeded to
the Guildhall, and, there meeting the chief amongst
the citizens, made them a speech which was an
admirable combination of appeal and independence,
and showed that if outwardly she bore no resemblance
to father or sister the Tudor spirit was alive in her.
She had come, she said, to tell them what they
already knew&mdash;of the treason of the Kentish rebels,
who demanded the possession of her person, the
keeping of the Tower, and the placing and displacing
of her counsellors.</p>

<p>That day marked the crisis in the progress of
the insurrection. Mary’s visit to the Guildhall had
taken place on February 2. When on the following
day Wyatt, leaving Deptford, marched to Southwark
the tide had turned. His followers were falling
away; no other part of the country was in arms
to support him; and his position was becoming
desperate. His daring, nevertheless, did not fail.
A price had been put upon his head, and, aware
of the proclamation, he caused his name to be
“fair written,” and set it on his cap. The act of
bravado was characteristic of the spirit of the
popular leader.</p>

<p>Meantime the measures to be taken against him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
were anxiously discussed. On the 4th Sir Nicholas
Poynings, on duty at the Tower, waited upon the
Queen to receive her orders, and to learn whether
the ordnance was to be directed upon Southwark,
and the houses knocked down upon the heads of
Wyatt and his men, quartered in that district.</p>

<p>Mary, to her honour, refused to authorise the
drastic mode of attack.</p>

<p>“Nay,” she replied, “that were pity; for many
poor men and householders are like to be undone
there and killed. For, God willing, they shall be
fought with to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The innocent were not to be involved in the
destruction of the guilty. Her decision was unwelcome
at the Tower. The night before Sir John
Bridges had expressed his surprise to the sentinel
on duty that the rebels had not yet been fought.</p>

<p>“By God’s mother,” he added, “I fear there is
some traitor abroad, that they be suffered all this
while. For surely if it had been about my sentry
[or beat] I would have fought with them myself,
by God’s grace.”</p>

<p>Wyatt, strangely enough, was no less pitiful than
the Queen. Although she had refused permission
for the discharge of the guns, they had been directed
by those responsible for them upon the spot where
the rebel body was stationed; and, in terror of
a cannonade, the inhabitants, men and women,
approached the insurgent leader “in most lamentable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
wise,” setting forth the danger his presence was
bringing upon them, and praying him for the love of
God to have pity. The appeal was not made in vain.</p>

<p>“At which words he, being partly abashed, stayed
awhile, and then said these, or much like words,
‘I pray you, my friends, content yourselves a
little, and I will soon ease you of this mischief.
For God forbid that you, or the least child here,
should be hurt or killed on my behalf,’ and so in
most speedy manner marched away.”</p>

<p>A meeting was to have taken place before sunrise
with some of the disaffected in the City. By
this means it had been hoped that a surprise
might be contrived. But a portion of Kingston
Bridge, where the river was to be crossed, had
been destroyed; time was lost in repairing it,
and the assignation at Ludgate was missed. The
scheme had supplied Wyatt’s last chance and
failure was staring him in the face. Rats were
leaving the sinking vessel. The Protestant
Bishop of Winchester, who had hitherto lent the
countenance of his presence in the camp to the
insurgents, fled beyond seas; Sir George Harper,
having rejoined Wyatt’s forces, deserted for the
second time, and made his way to St. James’s to
give warning to the Court of the approach of the
rebel leader.</p>

<p>Such being the condition of things, it is singular
to find that at the palace something like a panic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
was prevailing. Mary was entreated by her ministers
to seek safety at the Tower; and, though deciding
in the end to remain at her post, she appears at first
to have been inclined to act upon the suggestion.
A plan of action was determined upon in a hurried
consultation. Wyatt, it was agreed, was to be permitted
to reach the City, with a certain number of
his followers, and having been thus detached from
the main body of his troops it was hoped that he
would be trapped and seized.</p>

<p>In the meantime arrangements were made for
the defence of the Queen and the palace. Edward
Underhyll, the Hot-Gospeller for whose child Lady
Jane had stood godmother six months earlier, and
who was on duty as a gentleman-pensioner at St.
James’s, has left a graphic account of the scene
there that night, and of the terror of the Queen’s
ladies when the pensioners, armed with pole-axes,
were placed on guard in their mistress’s apartments.
The breach of etiquette appears to have struck them
as an earnest of the peril to which it was owing.
Was such a sight ever seen, they cried, wringing
their hands, that the Queen’s chamber should be
full of armed men?</p>

<p>Underhyll, for his part, soon received his
dismissal. As the usher charged with the duty
looked at the list of the pensioners before calling
them over, his eye was caught by the well-known
name of the Hot-Gospeller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
“By God’s Body,” he said, “that heretic shall
not watch here!” and Underhyll, taking his men
with him, and professing satisfaction at his exemption
from duty, went his way.</p>

<p>By the morning he had reconsidered the matter,
and thought it well to ignore his rebuff and return
to his post. For the present, he joined company
with one of the Throckmortons, who had just left
the palace after reporting there the welcome tidings
of the capture of the Duke of Suffolk at Coventry,
the two proceeding together to Ludgate, intending
to pass the remainder of the night in the City.
The gate, however, was found to be fast locked, and
those on guard within explained, with much ill-timed
laughter, to the tired wayfarers outside, that they
were not entrusted with the keys, and could give
admittance to none.</p>

<p>It was disconcerting intelligence to men in search
of a lodging and repose; and Throckmorton, in
especial, fresh from his hurried journey, felt that
he was hardly treated.</p>

<p>“I am weary and faint,” he complained, “and I
wax now cold.” No man would open his door in
this dangerous time, and he would perish that night.
Such was his piteous lament.</p>

<p>Underhyll, a man of resource, had a plan to
propose.</p>

<p>“Let us go to Newgate,” he suggested. He
thought himself secure of an entrance there into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
the city. At the worst, he had acquaintances within
the prison&mdash;like most men at that day&mdash;having
recently been in confinement there. The door of
the keeper of the gaol was without the gate, and
Underhyll entertained no doubts of finding a
hospitable reception in his old quarters. Throckmorton,
it was true, declared at first that he would
almost as soon die in the street as seek so ill-omened
a refuge; but in the end the two proceeded thither,
and, a friend of Underhyll’s being fortunately in
command of the guard placed outside the gate, the
wanderers were permitted to enter the City.</p>

<p>Whilst consternation and alarm were felt at
the palace at the tidings of Wyatt’s approach,
the rebel leader himself must have been aware that
the game had been played and lost. Yet he
kept up a bold front, and refused to acknowledge
that he was beaten.</p>

<p>“Twice have I knocked, and not been suffered
to enter,” he was reported to have said. “If I
knock the third time I will come in, by God’s
grace.”</p>

<p>They were brave words. An incident of his march
to Kingston nevertheless sounds the note of a consciousness
of impending defeat. Meeting, as he went,
a merchant of London who was known to him, he
charged him with a greeting to his fellow-citizens.
“And say unto them from me that when liberty
and freedom was offered them they would not accept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
it, neither would they admit me within their gates,
who for their freedom and the disburthening of
their griefs and oppression by strangers would have
frankly spent my blood in that their cause and
quarrel; ... therefore they are the less to be
bemoaned hereafter when the miserable tyranny of
strangers shall oppress them.”</p>

<p>It may be that by some amongst the men to
whom the message was sent his words were remembered
thereafter.</p>

<p>Still the insurgents pushed on. By nine in
the morning Knightsbridge was reached. Disheartened,
weary, and faint for lack of food, they
were in no condition to stand against the Queen’s
troops. But the mere fact of their vicinity was
disquieting to those in no position to form a
correct estimate of their strength or weakness, and
when Underhyll returned to the palace he found
confusion and turmoil there.</p>

<p>His men were stationed in the hall, which was
to be their special charge. Sir John Gage, with
part of the guard, was placed outside the gate, the
rest of the guard were within the great courtyard;
the Queen occupying the gallery by the gatehouse,
whence she could watch what should befall.</p>

<p>This was the disposition of the defenders, when
suddenly a body of the rebels made their way to
the very gates of the palace. A struggle took place;
Gage and three of the judges who had been with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
him retreated hurriedly within the gates, Sir John,
who was old, stumbling in his haste and falling in the
mire. Within all was in disorder. The gates had
clanged to behind Gage, his soldiers, and the men
of law, as they gained the shelter of the courtyard.
Without the rebels were using their bows and
arrows. The guard stationed in the outer court,
attempting to make good their entrance to the hall,
were forcibly ejected by the gentlemen pensioners
in charge of it. Poor Gage&mdash;“so frighted that he
could not speak to us”&mdash;and the three judges, also
in such terror that force would have been necessary
to keep them out, were alone admitted to the
comparative safety it afforded.</p>

<p>There was in truth little reason for alarm. The
manœuvre decided upon during the night had
been executed. The Queen’s troops, Pembroke at
their head, had deliberately permitted Wyatt to
break through their lines, and, with some hundreds
of his men, to proceed eastward. Behind him the
enemy had closed up, and he was separated from
the main body of the rebels, thus left leaderless to
be engaged by the royal forces. The Queen’s
orders had been successfully carried out. But to
the anxious watchers in the palace the affair may
have worn the aspect of a defeat, if not of a treason,
and there were not wanting those who suspected
Pembroke of a betrayal of his trust. A shout was
raised that all was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
“Away, away! a barge, a barge!&mdash;let the Queen
be placed in safety!” was the cry.</p>

<p>Again Mary was to show that she was a Tudor.
She would not beat a retreat before rebels. Where,
she inquired, was the Earl of Pembroke? and
receiving the answer that he was in the field,
“Well then,” she said, “fall to prayer, and I
warrant you that we shall have better news anon,
for my lord will not deceive me, I know well. If
he would, God will not, in Whom my chief trust
is, Who will not deceive me.”</p>

<p>Though it was well to have confidence in God,
men with arms in their hands would have liked to
use them, and the pensioners entreated Sir Richard
Southwell, in authority within the palace, to have
the gates opened that they might try a fall with
the enemy; else, they threatened, they would break
them down. It was too much shame that the
doors should be shut upon a few rebels.</p>

<p>Southwell was quite of the same mind; and,
interceding with Mary, obtained her leave for the
pensioners to have their way, provided they would
not go out of her sight, since her trust was in
them&mdash;a command she reiterated as, the gates being
thrown open, the band marched under the gallery,
where she still kept her place. It was not long
before her confidence in the commander of the royal
troops was justified, and news was brought that
put an end to all fear. Wyatt was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
At the head of that body of his men who
had been allowed to clear the enemy’s lines, he had
ridden on towards the City, had passed Temple
Bar and Fleet Street, till Ludgate was reached.
There he halted. He had kept his tryst, fulfilled
the pledge he had given, and knocked, as he had
promised, at the gate. Let them open to him;
Wyatt was there&mdash;successful so long, he may have
thought there was magic in the name&mdash;Wyatt was
there; the Queen had granted their requests.</p>

<p>The City remained unmoved; and, in terms of
insult, Sir William Howard refused him entrance.</p>

<p>“Avaunt, traitor,” he said, barring the way,
“thou shalt not come in here.”</p>

<p>It was the last blow. The poor chance that
the City might have lent its aid had constituted the
single remaining possibility of a retrieval of the
fortunes of the insurrection. That vanished, the
end was inevitable. London had blustered, had
expressed its detestation for the Spanish match,
had paraded its Protestantism; it was now plain
that it had not meant business, and the man who
had taken it at its word was doomed.</p>

<p>A strange little scene followed&mdash;a scene forming
an interlude, as it were, in the tumult and excitement
of the hour. It may be that the effects of the
strain and fatigue of the last weeks, of the hopes
and fears that had filled them, of the march of
the night before, unlightened by any genuine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
anticipation of victory, were suddenly felt by the
man who had borne the burden and heat of the day.
At any rate, turning without further parley, he
made his way back to the Bel Savage Inn, and there
“awhile stayed, and, as some say, rested him upon
a seat.” Sitting there, trapped by his enemies, in
“the shirt of mail, with sleeves very fair, velvet
cassock, and the fair hat of velvet with broad
bone-work lace” he had worn that day, he may
have looked on and seen the future bounded by
a scaffold. Then, rousing himself, he rose, and
returned by the way he had come, until Temple Bar
was reached.</p>

<p>Though the combat was there renewed, all must
have known that further resistance was vain, and at
length, yielding to a remonstrance at the shedding
of useless blood, Wyatt consented to acknowledge
his defeat and to yield himself a prisoner to Sir
Maurice Berkeley. He had fought the battle of
many men who had taken no weapon in hand to
support him. When false hopes had at one time
been entertained of his success “many hollow hearts
rejoiced in London at the same.” But scant
sympathy will have been shown to the vanquished.</p>

<p>It remained to consign the captives to the
universal house of detention. By five o’clock in
the afternoon, as the spring day was closing in,
Wyatt and five of his comrades had been conducted
to the Tower by Jerningham. They arrived by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
water, and were met at the bulwark by Sir Philip
Denny, who greeted the prisoners with words of
fierce upbraiding.</p>

<p>“Go, traitor,” he said, as Wyatt passed by, “there
was never such a traitor in England.”</p>

<p>Wyatt turned upon him.</p>

<p>“I am no traitor,” he answered. “I would thou
should well know thou art more traitor than I; and
it is not the part of an honest man to call me so.”</p>

<p>He was right; but courtesy to the defeated was
no article of the code of the day. At the Tower
Gate Sir John Bridges, the Lieutenant, stood, likewise
ready to receive and to revile his prisoners.
To each in turn he addressed some varied form of
abuse, taking Wyatt, who came last, by the collar
“in very rigorous manner,” and shaking him.</p>

<p>“‘Thou villain and unhappy traitor,’ he cried, ...
‘if it were not that the law must justly pass upon
thee, I would strike thee through with my dagger.’</p>

<p>“To whom Wyatt made no answer, but, holding
his arms under his side, and looking grievously
with a grim look upon the said Lieutenant, said,
‘It is no mastery now,’ and so they passed on.”</p>

<p>Thus ended Wyatt’s rebellion. Together with
her father’s treason, it had sealed Lady Jane’s fate,
and that of the boy-husband who shared her
captivity.</p>

<span class="subhead">Lady Jane and her husband doomed&mdash;Her dispute with Feckenham&mdash;Gardiner’s
sermon&mdash;Farewell messages&mdash;Last hours&mdash;Guilford
Dudley’s execution&mdash;Lady Jane’s death.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Those</span> anxious days when the fortunes of
England and its Queen appeared once more
to hang in the balance had sealed the fate of the
prisoners in the Tower. They must die. Mary had
been warned that the clemency shown to her little
cousin was unwise; she had struggled against the
counsellors who had striven to convince her that
the usurper, so long as she lived, was a menace
to the peace of the realm, and the stability of her
government. Their warnings had been justified,
and Jane must pay the penalty.</p>

<p>What was to be done was to be done quickly.
It was perhaps feared that, with leisure to reconsider
the matter, the Queen would even now retract her
consent to deliver up the victim; nor was there
any excuse for delay. The boy and girl already lay
under sentence of death; it was only necessary
to carry it into effect. So far as this life was
concerned Lady Jane’s doom was fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
It remained to take thought for her soul. With
death staring them in the face, many had been lately
found willing to conform their faith to the Queen’s.
Why should it not be so with the Queen’s cousin?
To compass this object Mary’s chaplain, Dr.
Feckenham, the new Dean of St. Paul’s, was sent to
plead with the captive, and to strive to reconcile
her with God and the Church before she went hence.</p>

<p>The ambassador was well chosen. Learned and
devout, he had been bred a Benedictine, and had,
under Henry VIII., suffered imprisonment on account
of his faith; until Sir Philip Hoby, in his
own words, “borrowed him of the Tower.” Since
then it had been his habit to hold disputations,
“earnest yet modest,” according to Fuller, in defence
of his religion, and was honoured by Mary
and Elizabeth alike. This was the man to whom
was entrusted the difficult task of convincing Lady
Jane of her errors. It was scarcely to be anticipated
that he would succeed, but he seems to have
performed the thankless duty laid upon him with
gentleness and good feeling.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Tower&mdash;his whilom place of captivity&mdash;Feckenham,
after some preliminary courtesies,
disclosed the object of his visit, adding certain
persuasive arguments, to which the prisoner made
reply that he had delayed too long, and time
was over-short to allow her to give attention to
these matters. The answer, in whatever sense it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
was meant, was sufficiently ambiguous to afford a
sanguine and anxious man grounds for hope that,
with leisure for discussion, he might win a favourable
hearing; considering his proposed convert
“in very good dispositions,” he went to seek the
Queen; and, describing his interview, had no difficulty
in inducing her to grant a three-days’ reprieve.
Friday, February 9, had been at first appointed for
the execution, and when&mdash;for reasons undisclosed
to the public&mdash;it was deferred until the following
Monday, the change may have given rise in some
quarters to expectations unwarranted by the event.
There were those determined to hold Mary to her
purpose.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 11th, Gardiner preached before
the Queen, dealing first with the doctrine of free
will; secondly, with the institution of Lent; thirdly,
with the necessity of good works; and fourthly,
with Protestant errors. After which he came to
the practical question in all men’s minds. He
asked a boon of the Queen’s Highness&mdash;that, like
as she had beforetime extended her mercy, particularly
and privately, so through her lenity and
gentleness much conspiracy and open rebellion were
grown, according to the proverb, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nimia familiaritas
parit contemptum</i>, which he brought in for the
purpose that she would now be merciful to the
body of the Commonwealth and conservation
thereof, which could not be unless the rotten and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
hurtful members thereof were cut off and consumed.
“And thus he ended soon after, whereby all the
audience did gather there should shortly follow
sharp and cruel execution.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>Whether or not Gardiner’s discourse was directed
against a tendency to waver in her intention on
the part of his mistress, it was proved that there
was nothing in that direction to be apprehended.
Meantime, armed with the boon he had obtained,
Feckenham had returned to the Tower, to beg the
captive to make use of the reprieve for the salvation
of her soul.</p>

<p>Lady Jane’s reply was not encouraging. She
had not, she told him, intended her words to be
repeated to the Queen; she had already abandoned
worldly things, had no thought of fear, and
was prepared to meet death patiently in whatsoever
form might please the Queen. To the flesh it
was indeed painful, but her soul was joyful at
quitting this darkness, and rising, as by God’s
mercy she hoped to rise, to eternal light.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>It was not to be expected that the priest,
a good man, full of zeal for his religion and of
solicitude for the dying culprit, would consent to
relinquish, without an effort, the attempt to utilise
the respite he had been granted. Of what followed
accounts vary, according to the theological proclivities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of the narrator of the scene, an early
pamphlet asserting that Feckenham, finding himself,
in reasoning, “in all holy gifts so short of [Lady
Jane’s] excellence that he acknowledged himself
fitter to be her disciple than teacher, thereupon
humbly besought her to deliver unto him some
brief sum of her faith which he might hereafter
keep, and as a faithful witness publish to the world;
to which she willingly condescended, and bade him
boldly question her in what points of religion soever
it pleased him.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>The attitude ascribed to Queen Mary’s chaplain
would seem more likely to be due to imagination
than to fact. It appears, however, that a species
of “catechising argument” did in truth take place
in the presence of witnesses, an account of which
was set down in writing, and received Lady Jane’s
signature. The only result of the discussion was
the strengthening rather than shaking of her convictions;
and though it was not until she stood
upon the scaffold that the last farewells of the
disputants were taken, Feckenham must soon have
been aware that his efforts would be made in
vain. It may be hoped that to the imagination
of the chronicler is again to be ascribed the
manner of the parting of the two on this first
occasion, when, feeling himself to be worsted in
argument, Feckenham is said to have “grown into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
a little choler,” and used language unsuitable to his
gravity, received with smiles and patience by the
cause of his irritation. It is further stated that to
a final speech of her visitor, to the effect that he
was sorry for her obstinacy, and was certain that
they would meet no more, Lady Jane, not altogether
with the meekness attributed to her, retorted that
his words were indeed most true, since, unless he
should repent, he was in a sad and desperate case,
and she prayed God that, as He had given him
His great gift of utterance, He might open his
heart to His truth.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>So the days passed, and the fatal one was at hand.
On Saturday, February 10, the Duke of Suffolk,
with his brother, Lord John Grey, had been brought
prisoners to the Tower; but it does not appear that
any meeting took place between father and daughter,
and Lady Jane’s leave-taking was made in writing;
sentences of farewell being inscribed by her and her
husband in a manual of prayers belonging, as is
conjectured, to the Lieutenant of the Tower, and
used by her on the scaffold. In this volume three
sentences were written.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Your loving and obedient son,” wrote Guilford,
“wisheth unto your Grace long life in this world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
with as much joy and comfort as ever I wished to
myself, and in the world to come joy everlasting.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">G. Duddeley.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Jane’s farewell followed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Lord comfort your Grace, and that in His
word wherein all creatures only are to be comforted.
And though it has pleased God to take away two
of your children, yet think not, I most humbly
beseech your Grace, that you have lost them, but
trust that we, by leaving this mortal life, have won
an immortal life. And I, for my part, as I have
honoured your Grace in this life, will pray for you
in another life.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Your Grace’s humble daughter,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Jane Duddeley</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The same book bears another inscription addressed
to the Lieutenant of the Tower, Bridges,
apparently at his own request.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Forasmuch as you have desired,” Jane wrote,
“so simple a woman to write in so worthy a book,
good Master Lieutenant, therefore I shall as a
friend desire you, and as a Christian require you,
to call upon God to incline your heart to His laws,
to quicken you in His way, and not to take the
word of truth utterly out of your mouth. Live
still to die, that by death you may purchase eternal
life, and remember the end of Methuselah, who, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
we read in the Scriptures, was the longest liver that
was of a man, died at the last; for as the preacher
saith, there is a time to be born and a time to die,
and the day of death is better than the day of our
birth. Yours, as the Lord knoweth, as a friend,</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Jane Duddeley</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such an admonition to the Lieutenant, written
when death was very near, is characteristic. It
was ever Lady Jane’s custom to use her pen, and
the habit clung to her. Tradition asserts that
three sentences, the one in Greek, the other in
Latin, and the third in English, were written by
her in yet another book; and though it has been
argued that she would have been in no condition
to compose epigrams in the dead languages at a
moment when death was staring her in the face,
there is nothing improbable in the story, unsupported
as it is by evidence. As a man lives, he dies; and
Jane had been a scholar and a moralist from her
cradle.</p>

<p>“If justice dwells in my body”&mdash;thus the
sentences are said to have run&mdash;“my soul will
receive it from the mercy of God.&mdash;Death will pay
the penalty of my fault, but my soul will be justified
before the Face of God.&mdash;If my fault merited
chastisement, my youth, at least, and my imprudence,
deserved excuse. God and posterity will show me
grace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
A letter of exhortation addressed to her sister
Katherine likewise remains, another proof of her
desire to impress upon others the lessons life had
taught her. Having been reading, the night
before her death, in “a fair New Testament in
Greek,” she found, on closing it, some few leaves
of clean paper, unwritten, at the end of the volume,
and made use of them to convey her final farewell
to the sister she was leaving behind, giving it in
charge to her servant as a token of love and
remembrance. As might have been expected, with
the thought of the morrow before her, death was
the recurrent burden of her theme. “Live still
to die,” she told little Katherine, as she had
told the Lieutenant of the Tower, “and that by
death you may purchase eternal life; and trust
not that the tenderness of your age shall lengthen
your life ... for as soon will the Lord be glorified
in the young as in the old.... Once more let
me entreat thee to learn to die.... Desire with
St. Paul to be dissolved and to be with Christ, with
whom even in death there is life.... As touching
my death, rejoice as I do ... that I shall be
delivered of this corruption and put on incorruption;
for I am assured that I shall, for losing of a mortal
life, win one that is immortal, joyful, and everlasting.”</p>

<p>Another composition is extant, said to belong
to this last period, and showing the writer, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
may be, in a more pathetic light than that thrown
upon her by disputes with controversialists, or
exhortations to those she left behind. This is
a prayer, exhibiting not so much the premature
woman as the child&mdash;a child, it is true, facing death
with steadfast faith and resignation, but nevertheless
frightened, unhappy, “unquieted with troubles,
wrapped in cares, overwhelmed with miseries, vexed
with temptations ... craving Thy mercy and help,
without the which so little hope of deliverance is
left that I may utterly despair of my liberty.”<a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>Of liberty it was, in truth, time to despair. It
is said that for two hours on this last night two
bishops, with other divines, made a vain attempt
to accomplish the conversion that Feckenham had
failed to effect<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>; after which we may hope that,
worn out and exhausted, the prisoner forgot her
troubles in sleep. And so the night passed away.</p>

<p>In another part of the great fortress young
Guilford Dudley was also preparing for the end.
It is said<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> that, “desiring to give his wife the last
kisses and embraces,” he begged for an interview,
but that she refused the request&mdash;not disallowed by
Mary&mdash;replying that, could sight have given souls
comfort, she would have been very willing; that
since it would only increase the misery of each,
and bring greater grief, it would be best to put off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
their meeting, since soon they would see each
other in another place and live joined for ever by
an indissoluble tie. If the story is true, there is
something a little inhuman&mdash;or perhaps only
belonging to the coldness of a child&mdash;in the wisdom
which, at that moment, could weigh and balance
the disadvantages of a leave-taking and refuse it.
It is not, however, out of character.</p>

<p>It had been at first intended that the two should
suffer together on Tower Hill. Fearing the effect
upon the populace, the order was cancelled, and it
was decided that, whilst Guilford’s execution should
take place as originally arranged, Lady Jane should
meet her death within the precincts of the Tower
itself. As the lad, led to his doom, passed below
her window, the two looked upon each other for
the last time. Young Dudley met the end bravely.
Taking Sir Anthony Browne, John Throckmorton
and others by the hand, he asked their prayers;
then, attended by no priest or minister, he knelt
to pray, “holding up his eyes and hands to God
many times,” before the executioner did his work
and he went to join the father who was responsible
for his fate, “bewailed with lamentable tears” even
by those of the spectators who till that day had
never seen him.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>A ghastly incident, variously recorded, followed.
His body thrown into a cart, and his head wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
in a cloth, he was brought into the Tower chapel,
where Lady Jane, having probably left her apartments
on her way to her own place of execution,
encountered the cart and those in charge of it,
seeing the husband who had passed beneath her
window a few minutes earlier living, taken from
it a corpse&mdash;a sight to her, says the chronicler, no
less than death. It “a little startled her,” observes
another narrator, “and many tears were seen to
descend and fall upon her cheeks, which her silence
and great heart soon dried.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> According to a
third account, she addressed the dead.</p>

<p>“Oh, Guilford, Guilford,” she is made to exclaim,
“the antepast that you have tasted and I
shall soon taste, is not so bitter as to make my
flesh tremble; for all this is nothing to the feast
that you and I shall partake this day in Paradise.”</p>

<p>It had been ten o’clock when Guilford had left
his prison. By the time that the first act of the
tragedy was over, a scaffold had been erected upon
the green over against the White Tower, and led
by the Lieutenant, the chief victim was brought
forth, “her countenance nothing abashed, neither
her eyes moisted with tears,”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> as she moved onwards,
a book in her hand&mdash;the same she gave afterwards
to Sir John Bridges&mdash;from which she prayed all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the way until the scaffold was reached. With her
were her two gentlewomen, Elizabeth Tylney and
Eleyn, who both “wonderfully wept” as they
accompanied their mistress; and Feckenham was
also present, her kindly opponent, perhaps even
now hoping against hope that success might crown
his efforts. As the two stood together at the place
of execution, she took him by the hand, and,
embracing him, bade him leave her&mdash;desiring, it
may be, to spare him the sight of what was to
follow. Might God our Lord, she said, give him
all his desires; she was grateful for his company,
although it had given her more disquiet than, now,
the fear of death.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Like most of her fellow-sufferers she had
come prepared with a speech. That her sentence
was lawful she admitted, but reasserted the absence
on her part of any desire for her elevation to the
throne, “touching the procurement and desire thereof
by me or my half, I do wash my hands in
innocency before God and the face of you, good
Christian people, this day,” and therewith she wrung
her hands, in which she had her book; proceeding
to make confession of the faith in which she died,
owning that she had neglected the word of God,
and loved herself and the world, and thereby
merited her punishment. “And yet I thank God
that He hath thus given me time and respite to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
repent. And now, good people, while I am alive,
I pray you to assist me with your prayers.”</p>

<p>After this, kneeling down, she turned to Feckenham,
who had not availed himself of her suggestion
that he should leave her.</p>

<p>“Shall I say this psalm?” she asked him; and
on his assenting repeated the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Miserere</i> in English,
before, rising again, she prepared for the end, giving
her book to Bridges, brother to the Lieutenant,
who stood by, and her gloves and handkerchief to
one of her ladies. With her own hands she untied
her gown, rejecting the aid of the executioner, and,
turning to her maids for assistance, removed her
“frose paast”&mdash;probably some kind of head-dress&mdash;let
down her hair, throwing it over her eyes, and
knit a “fair handkerchief” about them.</p>

<p>After kneeling for her forgiveness, the executioner
directed her to take her place on the straw.</p>

<p>“Then she said,</p>

<p>“‘I pray you despatch me quickly.’</p>

<p>“Then she kneeled down, saying,</p>

<p>“‘Will you take it off before I lay me down?’</p>

<p>“And the hangman answered her,</p>

<p>“‘No, madame.’”</p>

<p>The handkerchief was bound about her eyes,
blinding her.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” she said, feeling for the
block. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>Then, as some one standing near guided her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
she laid down her head, and saying, “Lord, into
Thy hands I commend my spirit,” met the blow
of the executioner.</p>

<p>Thus died Lady Jane Grey, most guiltless of
traitors; who, to quote Fuller’s panegyric, possessed,
at sixteen, the innocency of childhood, the
beauty of youth, the solidity of middle, and the
gravity of old, age; who had had the birth of a
princess, the learning of a clerk, the life of a saint,
and the death of a malefactor.</p>

Jane was attached to the Queen’s household in 1546, but I am
unable to discover any proof of the fact. Speed, in his chronicle,
makes two or three mentions of her, from which other biographers
have concluded that she was in close attendance on Katherine Parr
during the King’s lifetime. But it seems clear that he made a
confusion between Lady <em>Jane</em>, the King’s great-niece, and Lady
<em>Lane</em>, Katherine’s cousin, born Maud Parr, who was at that time
a member of her household.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
